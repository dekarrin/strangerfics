This repository is an attempt to archive, preserve, and restore a fan project of Cyan's Myst series
called "The Myst Journals" by Christopher Josepheson. It was a fun project, and it was sad to see it
disappear off the internet. So, it is being archived here. This repo is intended to include all
parts of the original fan project, including both the Myst Journals themselves and the Riven
Expedition. As far as can be determined, no work on a Myst 3 adventure was published, but if it is
found it would also be added.

Some updates to the styling and layout are added to 'restore' the site so it renders well on modern
browsers, but the text itself is otherwise left unchanged, including spelling, grammar, or
punctuation errors.

The main text is taken from the Wayback Machine and altered as needed as per the above. While this
project does make markup and styling modifications, the actual text itself was wholly and entirely
written by Christopher Josepheson.

To see an exhaustive list of the changes that were made, see the divergences.html page either in
this repo or linked in the footer of each page on the live site.

## Markup Notes

Body text is wrapped at 100 columns in source. Tabs are used for indents and have an assumed width
of 4 columns. Tabs will likely be converted to spaces in the future.
