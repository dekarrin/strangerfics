		<h1>Divergences</h1>
		
		<h2>Why Are There Changes?</h2>
		<p>
			This page lists intentional and unintentional changes from the original source made by
			Deka Jello in the process of updating these pages for reading in modern browsers. Some
			modifications were made with the intent of preserving the original as closely as
			possible. Typesetting is modified only when needed to be updated for modern standards.
			Non-presentation code was modified anywhere it does not comply with HTML5 standards.
			Spelling typos and other errors in the original work's text are modified only where
			failing to do so significantly impacts the readability, and will be called out on this
			page.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Known Issues (Unintentional Changes)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The original shows the first title at the top of the page with no margin. Swapping
				to use <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> appears to have caused this. Likely can be
				fixed with proper margin setting on the first H1 element.
			</li>
			<li>
				Some possible intended double-breaks were eliminated by formatting. The original
				body text will need to be checked with an old browser simulator to determine where.
			</li>
			<li>
				The tables on the image test page of the Riven Expedition have some kind of
				cell-internal padding added that makes them a bit taller than the original ones.
				This may also exist in the actual usage of them.
			</li>
			<li>
				Chapter 12 of the Riven Expedition has a missing image link in it. The src attribute
				points to 'images/square.gif' but this image isn't on the image test page and the
				Wayback Machine doesn't appear to have ever archived this image. It is possible it
				once existed, but cannot confirm at this time.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Intentional Changes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Any section marked "Restoration Note" is newly-added and gives information on
				archived versions selected and shown in the restoration and other relevant notes
				from the process of updating this site.
			</li>
			<li>
				All pages have a footer at the bottom noting that the formatting has been updated.
			</li>
			<li>
				All pages now have a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration at the top,
				making them render in HTML5 mode.
			</li>
			<li>
				All pages have a <code>lang</code> attribute added to the HTML element.
			</li>
			<li>
				All attributes on tags were modified to have quoted values.
			</li>
			<li>
				The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags for keywords were changed from using the
				<code>http-equiv</code> attribute to the <code>name</code> attribute.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>rev</code> attributes on <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags were replaced with
				approprate <code>rel</code> values.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mismatched <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags were made to match. While not strictly
				required to match in HTML5, it helped readability of the code when modifying other
				content for formatting.
			</li>
			<li>
				All main body paragraph content was standardized to have the same presentational
				indent and font. It appears the original had some errors causing the indenting and
				formatting of body text to be inconsistent. This change was applied only in cases
				where it wasn't explicitly obvious that the original text was intended to look
				slightly different.
			</li>
			<li>
				Double-space after sentences was updated to single space to match current style
				guides as of 2023.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spaces at ends of lines of runs of text were removed.
			</li>
			<li>
				A new CSS file called <code>deka.css</code> was added for formatting added
				sections such as resotaration notes and the footer.
			</li>
			<li>
				All code was indented for readability. Some code was placed on a new line from its
				original open tag in the process of doing this. Generally, body text is hard-wrapped
				in source at 100 columns, with a tab considered to take up 4 spaces.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added <code>class="wayback"</code> to links that were modified to go through the
				Wayback Machine.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added <code>class="defunct"</code> to links that don't go through the Wayback
				Machine and that do not appear to be live.
			</li>
			<li>
				Font specifications were preserved but were given web-safe fallbacks where they did
				not originally have them.
			</li>
			<li>
				References to the invalid <code>&lt;tc&gt;</code> tag in stylesheets were replaced
				with the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tag.
			</li>
			<li>
				Corrected "Lucidia Handwriting" to the correct "Lucida Handwriting".
			</li>
			<li>
				Styling of centered notes was modified to remove the unworking float-based layout
				and to use a percentage width instead, along with max and min widths. A small amount
				of padding was also added so the text does not go all the way to the edge of its
				box.
			</li>
			<li>
				Styling of the left-half of the torn Marker Switch clue was updated to make main
				body text float closer to the note and to make the note text look cutoff on the torn
				right side. Similar to the centered notes, padding was added, though slightly
				differently to make text flow off the right side.
			</li>
			<li>
				Updated the right-half of the torn Marker Switch clue in chapter 7 of the Myst
				Journals to match the left side in chapter 3, but going the opposite way. This
				changes it from the original, in which it was formatted as a centered table and did
				not match the other half at all.
			</li>
			<li>
				Updated the full Marker Switch clue in chapter 8 of the Myst Journals to match the
				torn fragments and heavily changed styling to match the two torn fragments.
			</li>
			<li>
				Updated the text on both Marker Switch clues to fit together and to match the exact
				text of the note in-game.
			</li>
			<li>
				Styling of <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> was modified to add margins to the sides,
				tops, and bottoms, so it appears offset from text as it would have looked in older
				browsers.
			</li>
			<li>
				Updated styling of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> to have max width of 1000px and be
				centered on the page. Also removed its vertical margins.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spurious closing <code>&lt;/form&gt;</code> tag removed from chapter 4 of the Myst
				Journals.
			</li>
			<li>
				Updated styling of tables used to show notes made by the main character. This
				includes removing obsolete tags and attributes and replacing them with CSS
				attributes attempting to simulate the intended effect.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added separator characters to bottom nav menu on chapter 6 of the Myst Journals to
				match the rest of the chapters.
			</li>
			<li>
				Top nav on chapter 8 of the Myst Journals was adjusted so the link to the previous
				page has the correct name of the chapter, "The Channelwood Age", instead of the
				incorrect "The Selentic Age".
			</li>
			<li>
				Updated image centering in the Riven Expedition to use CSS instead of obsolete
				<code>&lt;center&gt;</code> tags.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added alt text for several images in the Riven Expedition.
			</li>
			<li>
				Navigation for the Riven Expedition was updated to use CSS instead of small for
				styling.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added navigation links to the Riven Expedition's prologue chapter. Fixed nav links
				in general in the Riven Expedition, and added back links on the meta pages.
			</li>
			<li>
				Updated styling in definition lists in the Riven Expedition to make them stand out a
				bit from body text and not just appear to be a series of indented text.
			</li>
			<li>
				Updated styling of the note in chapter 10 of the Riven Expedition to more closely
				match previous notes. Also removed the manual breaks in favor of a CSS max-width.
			</li>
			<li>
				Normalized all titles in the Riven Expedition to have a space after the colon; e.g.
				<code>"The Riven Expedition: The Trap"</code> as opposed to
				<code>"The Riven Expedition:The Trap</code>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Catherine's note in chapter 17 of the Riven Expedition was modified to use a single
				<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag with <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags for spacing as opposed
				to multiple <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags in a single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This
				was done to match the other note in the Riven Expedition.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added a brief info blurb to the index page of the Riven Expedition that mirrors the
				one on the Myst Journals and links back to the main title page.
			</li>
			<li>
				Changed text at bottom of the Myst 3: Exile explanation page to link back to the
				main index page.
			</li>
			<li>
				Merged common styles across the site into a new stylesheet called
				<code>common.css<code>. Note: <code>deka.css<code> was called common.css in prior
				versions of the site; its name was changed to better reflect the contained styles as
				being related only to added pages and content.
			</li>
