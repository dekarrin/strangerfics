		<p>
			First and foremost I want to say thanks to everyone that has written over the years
			regarding <em>The Myst Journals</em> and <em>The Riven Expedition</em>. I'm glad you've
			enjoyed the stories, even after all of these years after the games have come out. I have
			tried to respond to all emails sent to me, but occasionally one or two slip through the
			cracks. Sorry about that.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reason I'm putting this up is to inform people that I will not be writing a narative
			walkthough for Exile at this time. Someday in the future I may write one, but it's too
			early for me to give a definitive answer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Myst Journals was written in approximately 4 months, the Riven Expedition took 3
			years. The time increase was because the story was more complex, and I didn't have the
			free time a published author would have to devote to the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I started the outline for prologue, I realized this would require the same amount
			of time I had given to Riven, and unfortunately I don't have that time  to spare right
			now. I'm studying for the CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional) certification, I
			have construction projects on the side, I'm in the middle of a large Perl programming
			project. Finally, I've been working on a couple of unique writing projects, unreleated
			to Myst. I would like to give these projects the attention they deserve, and not
			undertake any additional work at this time.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I feel the time is right, I will consider returning to this project. I would
			recommend <strong>not</strong> checking this site every day for an update. Updates on
			whether or not I will write the story will be posted to a Myst/Riven/Exile forum.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks,<br/>
