		<p>
			I felt a cold chill run through my body.  Not terribly cold, but cold enough to bother
			me. The only other feeling was a dull ache in my head. I usually only feel like this
			when I sleep in an uncomfortable position....
		</p>
		<p>
			Sleep?
		</p>
		<p>
			I lifted my head up, only to bring about a jarring sensation similar to a hangover. I
			looked around my surroundings. I had fallen asleep... <em>on a shipping dock.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			I attempted to slowly lift my body up from the ground, fighting muscle fatigue and the
			ringing inside my ears. I could hear seagulls in the distance and the ocean gently
			breaking on the dock I had rested on.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Where am I? How the heck did I get here?</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			There was only one ship at the dock, and I doubt that I could've arrived here on it. It
			had sunken to the point where only the lookout mast was sticking above the surface of
			the water. It looked as if water had slowly crept through the bottom of the hull,
			bringing the mighty vessel to its knees.
		</p>
		<p>
			I managed to get myself in an upright position and gave my surroundings a quick once
			over. At the other end of the dock was a staircase spiraling up the base of a hill,
			leading up to a giant monument of some sort. By the base of the stairway was a podium
			with a large electrical switch on it, like you'd see in an old industrial fuse box.
		</p>
		<p>
			To my left was a long retaining wall, with a walkway going alongside the top. On the
			other side of the walkway was a large building which resembled something out of ancient
			Greek architecture.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'd better find out where I am.
		</p>
		<p>
			I did a quick inventory of myself, making sure I wasn't the victim of a mugging from the
			night before. Satisfied that everything was in order, I decided to go about and find
			someone.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked up the stairs until I came to the very top, where the strange monument sat. I
			now noticed that it resembled a large gear wheel, half buried into the ground, and
			another gear laying on its side. Next to it was a podium similar to the one at the base
			of the stairs.
		</p>
		<p>
			From here, I could see a great deal around me. I could see the first building, with
			another one along side it.  The second building seemed to burrow deep into a mountain
			where a strange looking tower stood. I could also see the sunken ship, and what appeared
			to be a small forest surrounding one particularly massive tree that blocked the rest of
			my view. Wherever I was, I certainly didn't remember coming to this place.
		</p>
		<p>
			I continued looking around, and I suddenly realised that I was on an island. In almost
			all directions, all I could see was ocean, and from my high vantage point I was getting
			a good strong whiff of the sea air blowing in from the south side of the island
			(assuming that the far side of the island was south). How the bloody hell did I get
			here?
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked halfway down the steps and then along the concrete retaining wall. At the other
			end was another set of steps leading around to the front of the first building. From
			there, I followed a path that was made out of wooden beams laid down across the ground.
			I was about to enter the first building when I noticed a note on the ground. It looked
			yellowed and crumpled, but I was still able to read what it said....
		</p>
		<p class="regnote">
			Catherine,<br>
			I've left you a message
			of utmost importance in
			our fore-chamber beside
			the dock. Enter the number
			of marker switches on
			this island into the imager
			to retrieve the message.<br>
			<br>
			Yours,<br>
			Atrus<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Who's Catherine? Who's Atrus?</em> I put the note in my coat pocket and decided to
			try looking inside the two buildings.
		</p>
		<p>
			From the front, the two buildings appeared to be styled from ancient Greek architecture.
			The first building was circular with columns along the exterior wall connecting to a
			blue domed ceiling. At the front of the building was a wooden door, and another podium
			similar to the ones I had seen earlier. Perhaps these were one of the <em>marker
			switches</em> that was mentioned in the letter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Out of curiosity I flipped the switch. Nothing happened. No lights, no noises. The base
			of the switch sounded hollow when I kicked it, but I couldn't find a way to open it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second building was rectangular and appeared to extend into the mountain directly
			behind it. I tried walking along the side of the building, but the ground was too steep,
			and I had difficulty with the shoes I was wearing.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked back to the edge of the grass and rounded the corner to the door of the
			circular building. I gave the door handle a sharp tug and walked inside.
		</p>
		<p>
			The inside of the room was totally bare. Aside from several small spotlights aimed at
			the ceiling, the walls were devoid of any form of decoration. In fact there was almost
			nothing in this room at all. The floor was solid oak, polished and stained, making it
			stand out amongst the bright white walls. In the very center of the room was a massive
			laid back chair, similar to something I'd see in a dentist's office. Above the chair on
			a massive swinging arm was an apparatus unknown to me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Out of mild curiosity I sat down in the chair. The apparatus above my head was a viewer
			screen of some sort. It held a small screen, a bank of LEDS, a single button, and
			several rows of sliding levers. The LED bank displayed a date:
			<strong>Jan 1, 0, 12:00AM</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I played around with the sliders and pressed the button. The date had changed. Each
			slider would change either the month, the day, the year, or the time of day. But no
			matter what changes I made, the screen stayed blank. Disappointed, I stood up onto my
			feet and walked out of the building. As I closed the door, I flipped the lights off.
			Maybe the next building would have something of interest.
		</p>
		<p>
			The path branched off directly in front of the second building. Down the path, I could
			see a well, and some trees, but further down the path was obscured by a misty fog that
			lingered close to the ground. I continued along the path up the steps into the next
			building.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the interior of previous building had a spartan look to it, this building had a
			more distinguished look, a decor suited to a very classy museum, or an old library
			perhaps. In fact, judging by the large shelf of books at the far end of the room, I'd
			guess that this place was a library.
		</p>
		<p>
			The room was octagonal shaped, the only light coming from a massive chandelier hanging
			from an ornately painted domed ceiling. My footsteps echoed on the solid oak floor as I
			walked towards the center of the room. Flanking the large bookshelf were two paintings.
			One painting was of a passageway possibly in this same building, and another painting
			was of the doorway I had just entered from.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the left and right hand sides of the room were display shelves. Each one held a book,
			and a piece of paper, prominently illuminated by a banker's lamp  just above the shelf.
			Behind me was the doorway I entered from. To the left of the doorway was a fireplace,
			and to the right of the doorway was another painting.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned around at the final painting and stared at it for a second. It appeared to be a
			map, perhaps of this very island. At the bottom of the painting was a small plaque that
			read <strong>Tower Rotation</strong>, whatever that ment. If the map was oriented to a 
			compass heading, then the dock was to the south. There were no labels for the
			surrounding ocean or landmarks, but several areas of the map were highlighted. To be
			specific, the library itself and the domed building were marked with a white outline
			pen. The tower on the mountain was highlighted with a red tint.
		</p>
		<p>
			Why would these features be highlighted? Why wasn't anything labeled?
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned back towards the main bookshelf, hoping that I might find some more
			information. My hopes were soon crushed when I noticed that many of these books were in
			no condition to be read. I'd check book after book, only to find out that each one had
			been scorched in some fashion, or had all of their pages burned out, leaving a hardcover
			shell, deceiving the literate mind.
		</p>
		<p>
			Out of what was probably a hundred or so books, only four had survived. There was a
			fifth one that was still partially intact, but it appeared to be nothing but page after
			page of strange patterns. A strange puzzle for someone to figure out later, perhaps.
		</p>
		<p>
			I took the four surviving books and put them in a pile on the floor. They had appeared
			to be journals written by someone as of yet unknown to me. The pages were crinkled and
			dirty suggesting that the journals themselves had been through quite a bit.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first book detailed the accounts of a man who had traveled to a strange land where
			he encountered a tribe of intelligent monkeys.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Intelligent monkeys?</em> Primates perhaps. Natives with a lot of body hair? I could
			hardly beleive any of it, and yet the very nature of the book suggested that it was
			indeed a journal, written by someone who had actually encountered these beings.
		</p>
		<p>
			I dismissed the parts that I beleived were fictional and continued reading through the
			journals. Each once described a very different land, with different people and
			apparantly different levels of technology. Perhaps whoever wrote these books traveled
			from this island, maybe on the boat out on the dock.
		</p>
		<p>
			The names of the places were very strange. The Channelwood Age, the Mechanical Age,
			neither of which I have heard of. But the more I read, the stranger it became. In one of
			the books, the author gave an account of actually creating a boat. Unfortunately,
			something dreadfuly wrong happened and the boat somehow moored itself onto the rocks.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were also several names mentioned in the journals. Emmit, Prann, Will,
			Catherine....
		</p>
		<p>
			Wait. Catherine? This must be Catherine from the letter I found outside. Whoever wrote
			these journals appeared to be Catherine's husband. Perhaps it was this Atrus fellow who
			wrote the letter I found outside. It also appeared that the writer of these journals had
			two sons, Sirrus and Achenar. I continued reading, mentally absorbing the details into
			my head.
		</p>
		<p>
			After two hours of solid reading I stood up to get some circulation back to my legs. I
			had wondered whether the time reading those journals had been worth it or not. They
			talked about very strange lands, all islands of one sort or another that I had never
			even heard of. In some paragraphs the author gave the impression that he himself had
			created these worlds. Of course, if it turned out to be just fiction, then I guess the
			author did create these worlds in a way.
		</p>
		<p>
			I went back to the shelf and looked again at the burned books. I rummaged through a few
			of them at random. The few pages that were intact had very strange, intricate symbols on
			them, suggstive of a written language. The pages themselves were very course, yet
			delicate to the touch. Too bad I would never be able to read them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>There were the two other books....</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			At opposite ends of the octogonal room sat the two books on their display shelves. One
			book was red, the other one blue. Perhaps they were reference books of sorts, or merely
			books that were favored by whomever owned the library.
		</p>
		<p>
			I went over towards the red book and examined the thick volume. Next to the book was a
			red page the same size of the book, suggesting that it came from the book itself. I
			opened the book up and noticed that a few pages were indeed missing from the book.
		</p>
		<p>
			The single page, and the many pages of the book were filled with the strange symbols I
			had seen earlier. They indeed looked like some form of complex written language, unlike
			any language that I had ever seen before. At the end of the book on the right hand page
			was a small picture of a red cloud. I noticed at this point that the opposite page was
			missing. I took the single page from the shelf and placed it inside the book where it
			belonged.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly a glowing red light came from the binding of the book and the page mered with
			the spine of the book. I looked it over and there was no evidence that it had even been
			ripped out of the book!
		</p>
		<p>
			And then right in front of my eyes, the picture changed! The clouds began to move
			around, swirling in an eliptical pattern. The clouds disappated for a bit and then a new
			image appeared. The image of a person. A man.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Who are you?", the man asked.  There were other cries and words uttered, but I couldn't
			make out anything the man was saying. His image was fading in and out among the swirling
			clouds.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Red pages!" the man cried, and then he began to disappear. His image was soon lost in
			the clody mist in the small picture.
		</p>
		<p>
			I dropped the book in horror. <em>What kind of a place is this?</em>
		</p>
