		<h2>Exile Project</h2>
		<p>
			I've received numerous emails, and I <em>will</em> try to respond to them all, but it
			has been a busy couple of months. Without going into too many details, I've been doing
			some training for volunteer work, I fractured my wrist (which really makes typing fun),
			and I've been writing other stuff.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other stuff??
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, but don't get too upset. I just finished an article for SysAdmin magazine on
			installing and administering Jabber. If all goes well, it will be published in January.
			If you're more immediately curious about my technical writing skills, read one of my
			other articles "Jumpstart Begin/Finish Scripts" in the October issue of SysAdmin
			magazine.
		</p>
		<p>
			I do want to finish the Myst3 story, so I will try to give it priority. On the realistic
			side, SysAdmin magazine pays better, and I would like to use them as a way to break into
			writing for O'Reilly or other cool tech publishers. I promise that I will keep the work
			in balance.
		</p>

		<p>
			All Exile updates will be posted to this page.
		</p>

		<h2>Future Directions</h2>
		<p>
			Plans are in the works for updating The Myst Journals to reflect the changes as shown in
			Real Myst.
		</p>

		<h2>Created A Links Page</h2>
		<p>
			It's been far too long since the main page of this site has been updated. Since the
			Myst3 news has come out, I thought I'd use that as an excuse to create a
			<a href="./links.html">links page</a>.
