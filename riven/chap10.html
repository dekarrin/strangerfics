		<p class="note">
			To whomever reads this:<br>
			<br>
			You have linked to this Age by touching the linking window of the Myst book. Stay calm.
			For your own safety, stay in the log cabin until we find you. To signal us, set the
			clock to 12:00.
		</p>
				<p>
			I re-read the note out loud. I doubt that it would really calm down anyone that Linked
			to Myst for the first time, but Atrus and I agreed that the note would be better than
			nothing. As far as I knew, the Myst book was still sitting open on my bed, turned to the
			page with the Linking Window. If anyone else were to use it, they'd end up trapped here
			like I was.
		</p>
		<p>
			The note was tied to a stick stuck in the grass right beside the dock. On the dock, I
			had painted the words, "DANGER. DON'T TOUCH THE IMAGE" in large block letters. Anyone
			looking at Myst from the Linking Window should be able to see this. If not, then the
			handwritten note would tell them what they should do. <em>Sorry, but you really should
			have paid attention to the first warning.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus was standing at the top of the steps watching my every move. He shared my concern
			about others accidentally linking to Myst, but for different reasons. I didn't want any
			of my friends or colleagues trapped here with me; Atrus didn't like the idea of a D'ni
			Descriptive Book left in an Age he was unable to retrieve it from.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned back to Atrus. "Do you think this will be enough?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"It's all we can do," he replied. He turned around and walked up the path towards the
			library. I expected him to enter the library, but he walked past it towards the rocket
			ship. He looked back towards me and asked. "Are you coming?"
		</p>
		<p>
			I followed Atrus as he walked into the rocket ship. He walked towards the bow of the
			rocket ship and adjusted the slider controls that would grant him access to the Linking
			Book to the Selentic Age.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was only two days ago that I freed Atrus from the D'ni holding cell. But despite the
			fact that I helped him repair the Linking Book, he didn't even bother to spend any real
			time in Myst until now. He spent the rest of the day in D'ni working on a large book
			that sat on his makeshift desk.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Descriptive Book for the Selentic Age appeared in the bubble dome and Atrus reached
			out to touch it. His body glowed a bright yellow, and then it faded as the matter in his
			body was sucked into the Linking Window of the book.
		</p>
		<p>
			I stepped up to the bubble and touched the surface. An electrical current flowed through
			my fingers, extending into every nerve ending on my body. A light eminating from nowhere
			surrounded my vision on all sides, and I felt myself being <em>linked</em> from this Age
			to the next.
		</p>
		<p>
			The rocketship on the Selentic Age was identical to the one on Myst, except the musical
			insturments didn't work. Atrus was standing just outside of the rocket ship surveying
			the area.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Selentic Age had a thick foggy atmosphere that reduced visibility to about 50 feet.
			A light wind blew across the barren landscape.
		</p>
		<p>
			I caught up to Atrus. "So tell me again," he asked. "Where exactly is the Myst book?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"In my home," I replied. "It's totally deserted right now, and it should be for at least
			two months."
		</p>
		<p>
			"And how did you find it?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"It was given to me by the sole survivor of a family of archeologists. Her three
			brothers had disappeared years ago. Up until this point the book was hidden away in a
			box."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Disappeared?" Atrus repeated.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes," I said. "I had only started college at the time, but I remember it was pretty
			controversial. There were no scheduled expeditions, no advance warning that they were
			leaving, and in the end, no bodies were ever found. Nobody's sure where they are, but
			they were officially declared dead about 5 years after they disappeared."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Interesting," Atrus said. I wasn't really sure where this was going. If the Miller
			brothers had the Myst book at one time, could they have linked to Myst Island. Did Atrus
			know where they are?
		</p>
		<p>
			We followed the path towards the few surviving trees. Even though the sun wasn't easily
			visible in the Selentic Age sky, I could tell it was setting. I had never experienced
			night in the Selentic Age.
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus set his backpack down and opened it. He took out a complex tripod and telescope,
			similar to the scope I had seen in the Stoneship Age.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The problem is," Atrus said as he opened the tripod. "The Myst Book is essentially
			trapped where you are. You can't take a Book with you to another Age if you use that
			Book to link to the other Age. If I took another Linking Book to your Age and destroyed
			the Myst Book, then I'd simply be repeating the original problem."
		</p>
		<p>
			"So what do you want done about the book?" I asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Myst Book cannot be used as a link anymore," Atrus said. "Ideally, if and when we
			find a way to get you back to your Age, you must protect the Book at all costs. Make
			sure nobody even knows of its existance."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Can I use it?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus thought about my question for a minute as he attached the telescope to the stand.
			"Why would you want to? At this time, I can't even guarauntee that I'd have a stable
			means of getting you back to your Age. What works once may not work ever again.
		</p>
		<p>
			"No. I'm sorry but I can't promise anything. Not yet. If I can get you back to your
			world, and if I feel that you can safely travel back to Myst, I'll have a way to Link to
			your Age and tell you in person."
		</p>
		<p>
			"How would you find me?" I asked. One thing I never established was where on Earth the
			Myst book had ended up.
		</p>
		<p>
			"How does anyone find anyone else in your Age?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"We have addresses," I said. "You could look up my home on any map."
		</p>
		<p>
			When the telescope was finished, Atrus pointed it up towards the hazy gray sky. The sun
			had almost completely set. The stars in the sky were dim, and I could occasionally make
			out red streaks flying past the horizon.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Did you ever meet the Miller brothers?" I asked. "Did they ever travel to Myst Island?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus looked through the eyepiece at the night sky. "No, I never met your friends. But
			there is a chance that they may have linked to Myst Island at one time."
		</p>
		<p>
			"When?"
		</p>
		<p>
			He looked up from the telescope to face me. "Years ago, before recent events took place,
			it wasn't uncommon for us to leave Myst Island for days or weeks at a time. Myst was our
			home, but we felt secure leaving it since we controlled all of the Linking Books that
			lead to it. Of course, we didn't know what had happened to the Descriptive Book until
			you turned up.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Some time ago, I had returned to Myst Island with my family and I noticed that some of
			the Books were open. I didn't recall using the Books recently, so I was curious as to
			who was reading them. I investigated briefly, but in the end I concluded that Catherine
			or one of my sons had taken the Books out and forgotten about them. I never questioned
			the incident again until you mentioned it to me."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What Ages could they have visited?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Everdunes, Channelwood, you name it," Atrus said. "If they Linked through one of the
			Books that was destroyed in the fire, then there is no way we could get to them."
		</p>
		<p>
			"But, the Ages you Wrote on Myst must have had Linking Books to bring you back to Myst,
			right?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, but in most cases the Books were well hidden. It could be that they linked to
			another Age from Myst, but never found their way back."
		</p>
		<p>
			I began to feel nervous. If the Millers had traveled to Myst, anything could have
			happened to them. They could have linked to an unstable Age and vanished. They could be
			trapped in an Age that they had no way out of. They could have had the misfortune to run
			into Sirrus and Achenar. I was given a plausable solution to a mystery no other
			archeologist could possibly solve; and yet behind that answer were many more questions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus sensed my uneasiness and turned back to the telescope. "I could be wrong you know.
			Maybe your friends never used the Myst book. We have no way to prove it one way or the
			other."
		</p>
		<p>
			True. There is no proof they used the Myst Book. But their possesion of the Book
			increased the number of possibilities as to what could have happened to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			I looked up and noticed more red lights streaking across the sky. "What exactly are you
			looking at?" I asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Meteors," Atrus said. "This Age goes through changes." He took out his journal and made
			some notes. "I used some variations of passages from the Riven book and wrote them in
			this Age."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Riven?" I asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"It's another Age. The Fifth Age that was Written by my father."
		</p>
		<p>
			"So why did you copy the passages?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Experimentation. I wanted to study how those particular passages affected planetary
			orbits."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Did you learn anything?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"We always learn something," Atrus said. "Everything we do generates a learning
			experience. From everything I Write I learn something by direct observation or objective
			conclusion. If I don't learn anything from observation or conclusion, I determine that
			my observation isn't strong enough or my conclusions are flawed."
		</p>
		<p>
			"But what did you learn from using the passages?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"The orbit of this Age is fine. The orbit of Riven is fine. However, Riven's orbit
			contributes to other factors that makes Riven unstable."
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus pointed up towards the sky. "See the meteors?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes."
		</p>
		<p>
			"The meteors are the remains of another planet in this system. At certain times of the
			year, the Selentic Age and this other planet get close enough, that smaller meteors
			break away from the main group and fall towards the planet."
		</p>
		<p>
			"So how long will the meteors be a threat to the Selentic Age?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Probably for a few days or so. We're still far off as it is. The meteors will not
			destroy the planet, but they will present a problem every year."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What if this island is destroyed. You could loose the Linking Book back to Myst
			Island."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I always take precautions to ensure that I make it back to Myst."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Atrus?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"What will happen to Myst Island? What will you do when you find Catherine and rescue
			her?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus put down his journal and looked at me. "I don't know."
