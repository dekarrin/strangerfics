			My body felt disoriented as I completed the link. The walls all around me were spinning,
			and I felt my equilibrium sway from the effects of the new environment. I was inside
			another one of the fire marble domes.
		</p>
		<p>
			In front of me was the pedestal holding a Linking Book. I opened the book to double
			check what Age it would link to. The image of Gehn's latest Age came into view,
			centering around his bowl shaped office. At least the dome was still receiving power. I
			pushed the foot switch and the spinning of the fire marble dome slowed down. The outer
			dome opened up from around me, and the inner dome lifted upwards to protect the
			pedestal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Behind me I heard the sounds of the ocean. I turned around and walked onto a metal
			catwalk. Ahead of me was the smallest island on Riven. It was a single rock that leveled
			out to a plateau where a single building stood on top. The catwalk lead to a staircase
			leading to a tunnel going into the rock itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked towards the staircase looking out towards the sea. I couldn't even see any of
			the other islands of Riven. They couldn't be too far away because I could see a metal
			conduit connected to the fire marble dome that probably lead back to the giant dome.
			There had to be a way to get here before the domes were built. Perhaps the state of this
			island has deteriorated more than the others. Maybe it was sinking, or drifting further
			away from the island group.
		</p>
		<p>
			The building on top of the rock was made of metal and was probably 15 meters tall. It
			was a simple tower, with a shaft leading up to a larger sphere. On top of the structure
			was a windmill gently blowing in the breeze. There were no entrances or windows that I
			could see on the structure itself. The only way in appeared to be from the tunnel.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I approached the island, I realised that it wasn't made of rock at all. It was wood.
			The shape of the island suggested that this island was actually the stump of a giant
			tree. The catwalk was extending into the tree, making its way past the giant roots that
			reached into the ground. Moss patches were scattered around the roots. I vaguely
			remember Atrus mentioning a giant tree when he told me about one of the times he met
			Catherine. Could this have been the tree he was talking about?
		</p>
		<p>
			I found myself wondering what this tree looked like before it was destroyed. Was it tall
			and imposing, or was it short with long branches reaching out in all directions? I
			wondered how many Books Gehn could have made from the wood of this tree.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked up the stairs to the landing. I still couldn't see any of the other islands
			from this elevation. I entered the tunnel. Conduit lines ran along the inside walls, and
			electrical lamps were spaced out along the ceiling. The tunnel ended at an elevator
			shaft.
		</p>
		<p>
			The elevator did not appear to be designed for human comfort. The platform was circular,
			and the only body to the elevator car were the bars of a bell shaped cage. But the cage
			only surrounded the rear half of the elevator, leaving the rest of the car exposed. I
			looked up into the elevator shaft above me and saw nothing but darkness. There was no
			exposed cabling to move the elevator, but near the base of the patform, I could make out
			two wheels on opposite ends that ran along groves going up the shaft.
		</p>
		<p>
			Directly in front of me, behind the cage bars was a mechanism that looked like an
			elaborate doorbell. Three buttons connected by push rods lead up to a large bell with a
			lever running horizontally across the middle. By pushing the buttons, I could make
			simple sounds of metal hitting metal. Bing, bong, clank. The sounds reminded me of a
			simple music box or perhaps a wind chime of some kind. The lever made no noise at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hanging from a lever at the top of the cage was a trinagular shaped handle. I could see
			a control line running from the handle down along the side of the cage to the underside
			of the platform. I pulled the handle to see what would happen.
		</p>
		<p>
			I heard a metal clank and the platform shifted. The wheels on the platform started
			turning and I felt myself start to rise. The doorbell in front of me disappeared as I
			was lifted up into the shaft of the building. It became completely dark for a few
			seconds and then a light appeared from above. The walls of the elevator shaft
			disappeared as the cage arrived at the top of the tower.
		</p>
		<p>
			The room was large with metalic walls and a wooden floor. Near the rear of the room was
			an opening that went out to a balcony surrounded with cage bars. A window with similar
			adornments was at the other end of the room next to a wood burning stove and a pile of
			logs. In the middle of the room was a oval throw rug. There were baskets hanging from
			the walls containing fruits and other food items. All of this stuff was out of reach due
			to the bars of the elevator cage.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yeh fari di...", a voice called out from the balcony. A woman walked into the room from
			the other side but stopped dead cold at the sight of me. She was probably expecting a
			visitor, but not expecting it to be me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had seen the same woman before, from the imager in Gehn's survey room. She was tall,
			with long flowing black hair that ran down her sides in two tails. She wore a white
			dress with a long red flowing cloak that only emphasised her height. She walked a few
			feet closer to me, trying to make something from my appearance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Catherine.
		</p>
		<p>
			"You made it," she said in English. "But how did you get past Gehn?"
		</p>
		<p>
			I wasn't sure what to say at first. Was she expecting me, specifically, or was she just
			expecting any kind of rescue sent by Atrus. Perhaps despite the fact that she was in a
			prison, she still had some kind of contact with others on Riven. Maybe the Black Moiety
			were keeping in touch with her. But why wouldn't they have rescured her as well?
		</p>
		<p>
			"You must really believe I have gone mad," she said.
		</p>
		<p>
			Why would she suspect I believed that? Gehn tried to discredit Catherine earlier with
			stories that she had become some sort of self-righteous leader to the Moiety, but I
			didn't believe it. Maybe he was spreading the story to the other villagers in an attempt
			to further weaken sympathy for the Moiety. Catherine was probably in this prison for
			months. Maybe her confinement was eroding her own confidence in escaping.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I know what he's doing," she said after a pause. "He's watching you. He's waiting for
			you to make a mistake." A look of dread began to appear on her face. "He's hoping you'll
			lead him back to D'ni."
		</p>
		<p>
			"You can't let Gehn....", she started. She tried to think of the right words to say.
			"Atrus sent you to save me. But if Gehn gets back to D'ni he'll kill him."
		</p>
		<p>
			While Gehn spoke to me earlier with a calm, confident voice; Catherine spoke to me with
			concern and fear. She feared for Atrus' life, and perhaps her own as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			She then looked up to a point directly above me and walked closer to the cage bars.
			"Find the Moiety," she whispered. "They have the Book. Be careful."
		</p>
		<p>
			She then walked back a step. "Go, then. If you won't help me than I have nothing more to
			say."
		</p>
		<p>
			Huh? I didn't understand her at all. She turned around and then headed back towards the
			balcony.
		</p>
		<p>
			I looked up to where Catherine was looking a second earlier. On the high wall, there was
			a sphere with a tube extending towards the center of the room. This must have been the
			camera Gehn used to watch Catherine. Was anyone using it now? Could Gehn have made it
			back to the survey room from his Age in the time it took me to get here? I suppose it
			was possible. It was possible that it also could have been the Guild Master watching us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Catherine was putting on an act to throw me off, but she really only did it to fool
			Gehn.
		</p>
		<p>
			I thought about the situation for a moment. Catherine was undoubtedly supporting me in
			her attempts to rescure her, and she was obviously aware of my arrival on Riven,
			including the theft of my Prison Book from the Moiety. Now all I had to do was find the
			Moiety to get the Book back.
		</p>
		<p>
			I pulled the handle and the elevator cage lowered itself to the bottom of the shaft.
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus wanted me to free Catherine. What was stopping me from trying to break through the
			cage and taking her with me back to one of the other islands? If I did it quickly
			enough, maybe we could get away before Gehn could come after us.
		</p>
		<p>
			No, the only way I knew of to get off this island involved Linking back to Gehn's Age.
			He could easily trap us there by shutting off the power to the Linking Books. Besides,
			once I rescured Catherine where would I go. I still didn't know exactly how to signal
			Atrus to let him know I was ready.
		</p>
		<p>
			I would have to get the Prison Book back, and that would involve finding the hideout of
			the Black Moiety.
