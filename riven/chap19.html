		</p>
		<p>
			It was hard to describe my feelings at that moment. I was excited, tense, and downright
			frightened all at the same time. I felt like I was so close to going home, yet I feared
			that those that opposed me would not just stand by and let me complete my mission
			unopposed.
		</p>
		<p>
			I strugglng to maintain control in a situation that was rapidly going out of control.
			Never before had I done anything like I had done now. I'm not talking about my
			explorations on Myst, or my travels through the Books. What I meant was, never before
			had I rebelled on a scale like this. I had never challenged authority on a level that
			would be considered criminal back on Earth. I didn't want to consider what the
			consequences of my actions would be.
		</p>
		<p>
			Less than half an hour ago, I had captured the ruthless dictator of an Age that he
			himself created. I had no nobel visions of liberating the Rivenese, or rebuilding a more
			stable political environment. My only original goal was to rescue Cathering; and yet in
			doing so, I have played a major part in the rebellion started by the Black Moiety.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gehn would never finish his next Age. What would happen to the villagers now?
		</p>
		<p>
			As I walked up the steps towards the tunnel leading into the great tree stump, I felt a
			sense of anticipation. My job was nearly complete. Once I freed Catherine, Atrus would
			come and help me get home.
		</p>
		<p>
			I entered the elevator cage and looked over the bell mechanism in front of me. There
			were three buttons underneath connected to push rods leading under the bell, and a lever
			going horizontally across the middle. The left button made a "ding" sound, the middle
			button made a "clank" sound, and the right button made a "bong" sound.
		</p>
		<p>
			I took the timepiece out of my bag and listened to the notes it played. "Bong, ding,
			bong, bong, clank". The sounds were identical to the three possible sounds made by the
			bell. I tried replaying the same series of notes using the buttons in front of me. When
			I replayed the sequence, I pulled the lever on the bell from the left to the right.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cage bars in front of me began to rotate to the right until they were behind me.
			They locked into place and the platform began to ascend the elevator shaft.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the elevator arrived at Catherine's cell, she was nowhere to be seen. I was about
			to call to her, when she appeared from the balcony. She stopped when she saw the cage
			was open and tried to control her surprise. Then without saying a word she slowly turned
			left towards the table, and then slowly walked towards the elevator platform.
		</p>
		<p>
			Catherine was worried we were still being watched.
		</p>
		<p>
			When she felt sure that she was out of range of the scope, she walked onto the platform
			and pulled the handle. The elevator began to descend into the base of the tree. "We have
			to move quickly," she said in a hushed whisper. "Gehn's people may already know what's
			happening. Once we're back with the Moiety we'll have time to regroup."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Moiety? Wait, the last thing I wanted to do was go back to Tay.
		</p>
		<p>
			Her eyes focused on my pouch; she could see the Prison Book sticking out of it. "Can I
			see the Book?" I took the Book out and offered it to her. She opened it to the page with
			the gateway image and read the inscriptions. Since the Book was open, Gehn could
			probably see us now. He could see Catherine escaping with me, and there wasn't anything
			he could do about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			"You did it," she said. "We're all free. You captured Gehn."
		</p>
		<p>
			The elevator stopped at the tunnel entrance and the cage rotated counter-clockwise to
			let us out. Catherine paused for a second as if she just realised something. She closed
			the Book, unknowingly stopping Gehn from seeing us. "But there's still his followers,"
			she said. "I'm not sure what they'll do once they realise he's gone. We'll have to get
			the villagers to safety as soon as possible."
		</p>
		<p>
			I thought about that for a second. Gehn's ministers might start making examples of the
			villagers like Gehn did before shortly after Catherine arrived. His loyal subjects would
			probably assume that Gehn had finally been caught or killed by the Moiety. Innocent
			people could still come to harm once they realise Gehn was missing.
		</p>
		<p>
			And yet, they were too foolish to understand that Gehn didn't really care about any of
			them. If Gehn had deliberately left Riven with a real Linking Book, the Riven Guild
			Leaders would have still reached the conclusion that the Moiety were involved in Gehn's
			disappearance. They could end up destroying their own civilization in retribution for an
			attack that never happened.
		</p>
		<p>
			"You go back to the Temple Island and re-open the fissue," Catherine said. "I know it's
			risky, but it's the only way to signal Atrus. I'll try to make it back there as soon as
			I can, but don't wait for me."
		</p>
		<p>
			She turned around and ripped the control rods apart from the bell, preventing anyone
			else from being placed in the prison cell. She turned back towards the tunnel, but
			before she took off she spoke again. "Don't forget, the portal combination is in my
			journal."
		</p>
		<p>
			Catherine ran down the tunnel. "Good luck," she called out and then disappeared down the
			steps. I realised then that she still had the Prison Book. I didn't need it anymore; in
			fact, I preferred that someone else took responsibility for it. I didn't want to keep it
			if I couldn't guarauntee that sometime in the future, someone may accidentally release
			Gehn.
		</p>
		<p>
			I ran down the tunnel, towards the steps. Ahead of me I could see the fire marble dome
			close around Catherine's figure. I ran down towards the kinetiscope and used it to open
			up the dome. I entered the stolen combination into the slider rack and the dome closed
			around me giving me access to the Linking Book.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I linked to Gehn's Age, Catherine was nowhere to be seen; and the cage was raised,
			preventing me from going anywhere in the office. Did Catherine do this? Or was it one of
			Gehn's advisors?
		</p>
		<p>
			I looked on the floor and noticed a couple of torn pages sitting on the floor. All the
			Linking Books were vandalized, except for the Temple Island Book. Cathering was forced
			to use this Book, as was I. If anyone else Linked here, Temple Island would be their
			only means out as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			I Linked through the Temple Island Book and found myself back in the fire marble dome. I
			pressed the floor switch, and the dome opened up to let me out. Catherine's concerns
			about the Guild Masters had me more on edge than ever before. If any of them linked to
			Gehn's Age, their only way out was to come back the way I came. They would find me in a
			matter of minutes.
		</p>
		<p>
			I ran down the steps and summoned the lift. I rode the lift up to the basewall of the
			giant dome and ran down the path leading to the west side entrance. The interior of the
			dome was still rumbling from the sounds of the generators being left on.
		</p>
		<p>
			I left the dome from the east entrance, ran through the Gate Room, and made my way down
			to the scope mechanism. It was just like it was when I arrived. The link trap was
			broken, the giant knife cast a long shadow across the ground, and the area was deserted.
		</p>
		<p>
			I looked over the lid covering the portal. There were five blank buttons next to the
			handle on the lid. According to Catherine's journal, the combination to open the lid was
			3, 1, 1, 3, 4. I pushed the third button once, the first button twice, then the third
			and the fourth. I heard a small clicking noise underneath and the lid popped up. I
			lifted the handle exposing the portal window. Although the image was dark, I could see
			tiny points of light from an unknown distance.
		</p>
		<p>
			I used the control button to lower the scope. I lowered it until the base of the scope
			was resting on top of the portal. One more descent, and the tip of the scope would break
			the portal glass. But before I moved it any more, I decided to take a look through the
			scope.
		</p>
		<p>
			The scope revealed a field of stars surrounding a black patch of emptyness. It was
			beautiful. What did the Moiety call it? <em>The pool of stars.</em> It was like staring
			into the night sky. Was this what it was like for all Ages? For Earth? Did the D'ni know
			the secrets of this vast void that lay in between the normal existance of the Ages?
		</p>
		<p>
			I stepped back from the scope and pressed the button again. The scope mechanism tried to
			lower itself but failed. The gears of the motors made clicking noises as they struggled
			to move. I ran my hands along the inner rails of the scope mechanism. On the left hand
			rail, there was a small stopper that prevented the scope from breaking the portal
			window. I lifted the stopper and pressed the button again.
		</p>
		<p>
			The scope lowered itself and the glass portal shattered. The glass fell into the fissure
			and an air current began flowing into the open portal. Sand and debris along the ground
			started to get sucked in and I could feel the wind pulling at my hair.
		</p>
		<p>
			I stepped back from the portal as the metal skin surrounding the portal began to weaken
			and get pulled down into the fissure. The twin rails supporting the scope bent under the
			stress and the scope toppled towards me. I backed out of the way just as the entire
			assembly was sucked into the fissure, leaving only the guardrail and a rubber hose
			releasing compressed steam into the fissue.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sky suddenly became dark and the ground rumbled. The wind was picking up and the air
			became colder. Rocks were falling from the mountain surrounding the great dome. Two
			large rocks fell from the mountain and smashed into the metal skin shifting it loose
			enough to fall into the fissue as well. The giant Moiety knife that had been placed
			there to hold Riven together was shook loose as the Temple Island was being split apart.
			It tumbled into the fissue closely following the scope assembly.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>This had to be enough of a sign for Atrus.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			I watched as the bricks around the giant fire marble dome cracked, and the entire
			structure shifted. While the foundation crumbled, the dome still maintained its shape.
			Finally, enough of the underlayment crumbled, sending the dome tilting off the far side
			of the island. The conduit pipes that were connected to the sides of the brick twisted
			and snapped. Arcs of electricity sprang from the smaller inner conduits until the
			distance was too great to maintain an electron flow. I saw the inner mechanisms of the
			dome fall into the pool of water and short out, bringing the grinding noise of the
			generators to an abrupt halt.
		</p>
		<p>
			Off in the distance, I heard creaking noises coming from the south side of the island. A
			MagLev was coming to this island from the Jungle Island. I could only really see it from
			its headlight. The car was being hit with ocean waves and high winds making for a very
			turbulent journal. The nacelles of the car made a screeching noise as they banged
			against the rails. The rails were beoming twisted in the increasing tremors, and the
			foundations of the supports were being severly tested by the increasing tidal waves.
			When the car disappeared from view, the rails finally broke apart preventing anyone else
			from using it.
		</p>
		<p>
			And then I heard something new. It sounded like somebody was Linking in. Atrus' body
			came into view inside the shelter of the link trap. He stepped out of the cage and put
			his arm up to his face to block the fierce winds. Above me I heard the wooden bridge
			swaying in the wind. I ran towards Atrus just as the bridge collapsed on the ground
			behind me, and tumble into the fissure.
		</p>
		<p>
			The pressure in the air had now become equalized. Objects were no longer being blown
			into the fissure, so we were safe standing near the ledge. Atrus came over to me and
			pulled his goggles down.
		</p>
		<p>
			"There isn't much time," Atrus yelled over the wind. "Where's Catherine? Where's the
			Book?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Atrus!"
		</p>
		<p>
			We both turned to see Catherine running towards us from the staircase. She was holding
			the Prison Book and the Tay Book. "Catherine," Atrus yelled. Atrus ran towards her and
			they both met in the middle, embracing each other in a hug that no earthquake would have
			been able to stop.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a few seconds they finally let go of each other and stared into the eyes of their
			other half. Atrus reached out and stroked Catherine's cheek.
		</p>
		<p>
			Catherine looked my way, and ran towards me smiling. "The villagers are safely in the
			Rebel Age," she said. Atrus walked up behind her and put his arm around her shoulder.
			She looked up towards her husband's face and smiled. "I thank you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"As do I," Atrus said. It took him awhile to find the words. "You've accomplished more
			than I could have hoped for. You've given me back my life."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Temple Island shifted again, sending a hailstorm of pebbles raining down on us from
			above. We all shielded our faces and Atrus took a Linking Book out of his pouch. "The
			path home is now clear for all of us," he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			The pebbles stopped just long enough for Atrus to open the Book to the descriptive
			window and held it out towards Catherine. Catherine's face was overcome with emotions.
			She caressed Atrus' cheek, running her fingers through his beard, and turned to me and
			smiled. She placed her hand on the window and Linked.
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus closed the Book and turned to face me. The wind had died down some, so he no
			longer had to yell. "This is where our paths must part. Perhaps we'll meet again
			someday. You know where to find me."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Wait," I said. I reached into my satchel and took out the two framed photograhs I had
			taken from Gehn's Age. "I thought you would want these."
		</p>
		<p>
			Atrus looked at the two photos and a smile came across his face. He didn't say anything,
			but his expression told me that he was grateful. He quickly put the pictures into his
			bag. Atrus walked to the ledge of the fissue and held the open Book in his outstretched
			hand. He turned back to me. "Goodbye my friend," he said. He placed his other hand on
			the page and vanished. The Book hung in the air for a split second and then fell into
			the fissue.
		</p>
		<p>
			I watched the Book tumble down past the rocks into the starry void. As I saw the Book
			disappear I knew then how I was going to get back home. This was where the Myst Book
			fell, during that confrontation long ago between Atrus, Catherine, and Gehn. If I were
			to follow the same path, it should take me back to Earth.
		</p>
		<p>
			I stood at the edge of the ledge. Should I jump? Could I clear the rocks easily?
		</p>
		<p>
			But before I could decide, the ledge underneath me gave way. The rock skidded down into
			the fissue with me still standing on it. Rocks were tumbling all around me as I fell at
			an alarming rate. The crevice extended down about 20 feet, and beyond that was the
			emptyness of space. The rock slipped out from underneath my feet and I found myself
			free-falling down the rest of the fissure.
		</p>
		<p>
			And then everything became calm.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first thing I noticed was the sudden silence. And then it was the absense of
			everything around me. I could see thousands of stars all around, and yet they were
			lightyears away. I had a mild sensation of falling but there was nothing close enough to
			give me a visual indication as to how fast my descent was.
		</p>
		<p>
			I twisted my body around until I could see the fissue. It stood out in middle an empty
			void in the pool of stars, slowly fading away into the distance. I could make out
			flashing lights inside the fissue from the violent final moments of Riven's existance. I
			had no way of knowing for sure, but my suspicions had told me that Riven was finally
			collapsing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Farewell, Atrus.
