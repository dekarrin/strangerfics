		</p>
		<p>
			I stepped away from the MagLev and looked out towards the ocean. I was on a higher
			elevation than on the first island. About thirty feet below me, I could see the waves
			crashing against the rocks. I imagine that the MagLev was the only means of getting
			between these two islands.
		</p>
		<p>
			Behind me the MagLev waited with its ramp open in the bay. A series of blue running
			lights on short poles flanked the craft for assisting the driver in locating the bay at
			night. There were no other signs or indicators of any kind. I wondered if anyone had
			monitored my arrival here.
		</p>
		<p>
			A single path lead through the surrounding rocks directed me past the landing. At the
			end of the path was a cave. Directly across the cave was a small object that appeared to
			be wedged into the rock wall.
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon closer inspection the object appeared to be a wooden ball with a highly detailed
			eyeball painted on it. When I touched the ball it moved along the metal ring that held
			it against the rock. I touched the top half of the eye and found that I could rotate it
			along its x-axis. The ball flipped over and revealed a symbol.
		</p>
		<div class="centered">
			<img src="./images/d3.gif" alt="[Dni Three]">
		</div>
		<p>
			As I let go of the ball, it rotated back to reveal the image of the eye. The ball made a
			chirping noise as it rocked back and forth in the socket. I copied the symbol down in my
			journal.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned to the cave and made my way up a wide staircase. Lanters were mounted into the
			rock wall every few feet to help guide my path. At the far and of the cave was an exit
			leading to another staircase going up the side of the hill. Next to the staircase was
			another blue button mounted on a pedestal, similar to the one at the other Mag Lev
			station.
		</p>
		<p>
			The path intersected with a staircase, going right up the side of the hill, and left
			down to a beach far below. I turned left, leaning against the surrounding rock to
			maintain my balance.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I made my way down the stairs, I could make out a large rock about five feet off of
			the shore. Resting on the rock were a pair of strange creatures, basking in the bright
			morning sunlight. They were definately marine life judging by their smooth bodies and
			flipper arms. Their bodies were covered with a thick black hide, with a white stripe
			going down their bellies. Their mouths were long like a pelican's. The overall shape of
			these creatures resembled a rather large seal or walrus. If animal life on Riven was
			similar to animal life on Earth, then these creatures were probably mamals. I wondered
			if they would exhibit the similar personality traits of Earth sea life.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly, one of the creatures looked up. It turned its head to the left and the right
			as if alerted to a presence. I continued moving slowly, testing whether or not they
			detected my presence. The first one suddenly shifted its large body and wobbled off the
			side of the rock. Its brother, believing there was a danger present, followed suit. I
			could make out their shapes in the water as they swam away from the rock to the outlying
			ocean.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beautiful. Simply Beautiful. None of the other Ages had ever displayed such examples of
			animal life. In the other ages they were either non-existant, or were driven away from
			the human colonies residing in the Ages. I was curious to see what other animals I would
			find on Riven.
		</p>
		<p>
			I continued down the steps to a path that ran along the side of the hill. I stepped off
			the path down to the rock where the creatures had rested. A small lagoon surrounded the
			rock with an assortment of trees and plant life.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked along the lagoon careful not to disturb the rock itself. This could very well
			be the creatures' nest and I didn't want to do anything to disturb it. There may be eggs
			or young nearby that could be harmed by my being there.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the far and of the lagoon I looked out towards the empty ocean. No other islands were
			in sight, no ships, no signs of life. From the map I drew inside my head, the other
			islands I saw were on the other side of this island. According to my compass, I was
			facing East.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned around back to the path when I noticed another wooden eyeball. This one was
			placed on a small rock on the sea creature's nest, facing out towards the lagoon.
			Carefully, I waded into the water, surprised by the warmth of it. The ball was identical
			to the one I had seen earlier. I placed my hand on the eye and pulled it downwards. The
			eye rotated in the socket revealing another symbol.
		</p>
		<div class="centered">
			<img src="./images/d5.gif" alt="[Dni Five]">
		</div>
		<p>
			When I let go of the ball it righted itself back until the eye was showing, making a
			hollow trumpeting noise as it moved.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked back to the sandy beach and onto the path. I continued along the side of the
			hill until another cave entrance appeared. The entrance of this cave appeared to be
			carved out of the trunk of a large tree which had been chopped down some time ago.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cave was lighted by fire marbles staked into the rock on thin poles. The cave steps
			sloped upwards, and I could make out natural light source ahead of me. I could also hear
			the sound of water, possibly a lake or a waterfall.
		</p>
		<p>
			I emerged from the cave to the inside wall of a large crater. Forty feet below me the
			crater was filled with water, forming a deep lake. The water was so clear I could make
			out the rock formations along the bottom. I scanned the surface of the lake with my
			eyes, and that was when I noticed the village.
		</p>
		<p>
			All around the lake were buildings and structures. At the far end of the lake sat a
			collection of tiny huts made of earth and clay. The huts were settled high along the
			crater wall on a network of supports. Walkways and ladders made out of bamboo allowed
			travel between the huts. Down below I could make out a boardwalk above the water where
			children played while the adults worked and went about their business. I had found the
			people of Riven.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, they had also found me.
		</p>
		<p>
			A low whailing noise came from a tower to my right. It was an enclosed one man tower
			perched along the rock just above my head. Through the windows I could make out a man
			inside the tower feverishly cranking a large handle just above him. At the very top of
			the structure was a set of horns that rotated in time with the movements the guard made.
			The similarities of the horns on Riven and horns I heard back on Earth stuck a bell. I
			had just encountered the Riven Civil Defense Squad.
		</p>
		<p>
			I immediately darted back into the cave. I ran at a careful pace down the stone steps
			and back outside to the beach. I continued running along the path past the large rock
			where the sea creatures rested. I never once looked behind me as I ran up the tall steps
			back to where I came from. Only I didn't go back through the cave to where the Mag Lev
			sat. I knew what was in that direction, a potential dead and with no place to hide.
		</p>
		<p>
			I continued up the steps and found I had reached the top of the mountain. Tall blades of
			grass blew in the breeze next to a tree stump that appeared to have been cut recently. I
			turned back, but didn't see any guards following me. To my right I could see the ocean
			and another island.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ahead of me was a rope bridge with wooden planks. Below the bridge was a dense valley of
			jungle foilage. I carefully walked across the bridge with both of my hands close to the
			rope handrails, in case the bridge was not as sturdy as it appeared.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other side of the bridge was a large forest that appeared to have its days
			numbered. Between the bridge and the forest were a scattering of tree stumps, all from
			trees that had to be somewhere between fifty and a hundred years old at least. One tree
			trunk had a gigantic axe handle stuck in the middle as if Paul Bunyon had placed it
			there at the end of a long workday. Hundreds of tiny black insects hovering above the
			tree trunks, clinging to the remains of what was probably once their homes. Winding
			between the stumps was a man-made path leading into the forest.
		</p>
		<p>
			I followed one trail into the forest, where a wooden door hung between two trees to
			create an entrance into the forest. I pulled open the wooden door and it swung closed
			behind me. I peered through the slats of the door to see if my pursuers had made it
			across the bridge yet. Nothing. Nobody had followed me here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Why didn't anyone follow me? After all, I apparantly alarmed these people. Maybe there
			was only the one guard in the area, and he was in the tower. I didn't think to look at
			the guard more closely to see if his uniform was with a white coat like the first guard
			I saw, or with a red sash like the one who had rescued me.
		</p>
		<p>
			No. The second man I encountered wasn't a guard. His actions were more like that of a
			terrorist, or a revolutionary in enemy territory. The sneak attack on the first guard
			was not something a person of an official capacity would do.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides, the first person had that five pointed symbol on his cap, identical to the
			crest in the Hub Room. From the dominating presence of that symbol I could safely assume
			that this guard was with the controlling faction that ruled this Age.
		</p>
		<p>
			If I were to expand on my deductions, I could assume that Gehn was a powerful influence
			in this Age, perhaps the ruling monarchy. Gehn had named Riven the Fifth Age, which
			could coincide with the pentagon shaped crest. It could also mean that Gehn was probably
			the ruling person in those stained glass images. Too bad I didn't know what Gehn looked
			like.
		</p>
		<p>
			I still had no real proof of any of these theories. My reasoning was based on a
			collection of observations at this point, with no hard evidence saying that this man is
			Gehn. For all I knew Gehn could very well be dead, and those images could be twenty
			years out of date.
		</p>
		<p>
			I waited by the door for another five minutes. Still no guards appeared. I turned back
			towards the path and walked through the thick forest. The trees surrounded the path
			which went into the middle of the jungle and then turned sharply towards a set of stairs
			running down a hill. I continued down the steps along the path, the trees becoming more
			imposing the further along I went.
		</p>
		<p>
			The only light came from outside the thick forest, filtering through the trees. Through
			the sounds of the bugs and the crickets I could still hear the waves of the ocean
			breaking on the surf forty feet below.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wondered what the forest looked like before the other trees were cut. By the size of
			the area covered by tree trunks, I estimated that a third of the jungle was now gone. To
			what degree was the Riven ecosystem affected by the cutting of trees on a tiny island in
			the middle of an endless ocean.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ahead of me, the trunk of a tree was bored through to allow the path to continue in a
			straight line. Off to the side of the tree was a gigantic sword wedged into the ground
			at an angle.
		</p>
		<p>
			This sword was shaped differently than the one by the linking trap. The circular guard
			around the handle was gone, and the blade was wide in the middle making a deeper gash as
			the sword penetrated the earth. I stepped off the raised path to more closely examine
			the towering symbolic weapon. As I approached the metal blade I stubbed my toe on
			something sharp on the ground.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hopped back on one foot and looked down at the ground below. Next to the giant blade
			was a small replica of the giant sword I saw on the first island. Identical to the one
			the rebel used to damage the link trap. It was as if these tiny weapons were the symbol
			these people wanted to be known by.
		</p>
		<p>
			The only difference between this blade and the others was that a fire marble was wedged
			into the handle so it could be noticed in the dark, or so perhaps people wouldn't trip
			over it. Next to the symbolic blade was another one of the wooden eyeballs.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned this eyeball like I did the others and I found another symbol:
		</p>
		<div class="centered">
			<img src="./images/d4.gif" alt="[Dni Four]">
		</div>
		<p>
			As the ball rotated back it made a heavy breathing sound, almost like a low coughing. I
			tried rotating the ball again just to listen to the sound. It didn't sound like the
			second eyeball I found, and I couldn't remember what the first eyeball sounded like, but
			each sound was vaguely different. Maybe the differences were the surfaces that the
			eyeballs were mounted on.
		</p>
		<p>
			I went back to the path which continued on through the trunk of a larger tree ahead.
			Mounted on top of the tree trunk was a large rotating dome, similar to the one I had
			seen on the other island. I walked inside the tree trunk where the path forked in two
			directions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The left path lead up to a staircase to another wooden door that looked like it lead out
			of the jungle. I walked halfway up the steps and turned around to look at the dome.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tree trunk was about fifteen feet high. The dome took up the entire trunk's surface
			along with a metal walkway that circled the dome. I could make out a string of markings
			on the surface of the dome, all evenly placed along the same latitude.
		</p>
		<p>
			The walkway was suspended at the same level as the dome and went off towards the trees
			at the other side of the jungle. I went back underneath the tree trunk and through the
			other path in the fork to see if I could follow the walkway.
		</p>
		<p>
			The path turned into another set of stairs descending below a low overhanging tree
			branch. The quality of the trail degraded to the point of where I was walking on dirt.
			There was a small dirt patch that broke a tiny pond in half as the path lead to an patch
			of grass.
		</p>
		<p>
			Directly in front of me was a large red idol mounted onto the body of one of the larger
			trees. The idol resembed a large bull headed creature with two massive tusks sticking
			out from its mouth. An elephant of some sort? A massive jungle dweller?
		</p>
		<p>
			At both of my sides were two small lamps stuck into the ground. Tiny, hidden spotlights
			at the far corners of the area shone directly onto the idol bathing it in a errie red
			light. Above the idol I could find the walkway lead directly into the body of the tree.
		</p>
		<p>
			I went back through the jungle to where the large sword was nestled in the bushes. My
			feet were getting tired and I wanted to rest for a bit. I sat down on the ground next to
			the tiny metal arrowhead and removed my pack. I ate some of the food I had packed along
			as I wrote down some of my obervations in my journal. My notes were still sketchy at
			this point, but I reminded myself that I still had a lot of exploring to do. Sooner or
			later, what I had down would start to make sense.
		</p>
		<p>
			More than anything else I wanted to explore the village, but I knew it was too risky to
			return, especially so soon after I was discovered. I still hadn't seen any sign of a
			search party. They knew immediately that I was an outsider, so why hesitate?
		</p>
		<p>
			After I finished my lunch, I took my backpack and hid it in a nearby bush. I would make
			the jungle my camp for now until I found a more suitable place. I doubt that anyone else
			would find it in here.
		</p>
		<p>
			I made my way back onto the path and went through the fork in the tree trunk. This time
			I continued on the left path to the staircase. Before me was the wooden door leading
			out. I waited behind the door to see if there were any signs of movement. After a minute
			or so, I was convinced that nobody was waiting outside for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I opened the door and stepped onto a wooden bridge that created a walkable path through
			a narrow gourge. The path lead brached off to the left and the right; the left leading
			back to the hillside, and the right leading down into a cave.
		</p>
		<p>
			I almost decided to take the right path when I noticed the tower. Another watchout
			tower, identical to the one that spotted me earlier was here, suspended in the air by a
			single pole stuck deep into the rock directly below it. The very top of the tower looked
			just over the crevice, where the guard was currently looking. Very carefully, I backed
			up towards the open doorway, not once taking my eyes off of the guard. Once inside the
			door, I slowly closed it, trying to make as little noise as the squeaky hinges would
			allow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now what?
		</p>
		<p>
			From what I could find, these two doorways were the only way out of the jungle. This one
			was monitored by a guard, and the other one lead back to a path that I had already
			explored. Where else could I go?
		</p>
		<p>
			I made my way through the jungle to the entrance I first came to. After peering through
			the door to see if any guards were in the area I opened the door and walked out onto the
			path. Off to my left I noticed that one of the paths went down a small slope. At the end
			of the path was a hole in the ground. The hole was square shaped with a concrete
			reinforced edge, suggesting that this was a man made tunnel.
		</p>
		<p>
			I looked down the hole to find it was about two meters deep. At the botton of the hole
			was a large metal cart mounted on twin rails. The rails ran through another hole going
			horizontally into the ground. The cart appeared to be made for the transport of supplies
			or materials. The botton of the cart was covered with broken twigs and tree branches. A
			lever was mounted on one of the concrete walls next to the tunnel entrance.
		</p>
		<p>
			I lowered myself into the cart to try to see where the tunnel lead. I tunnel entrance
			was barely large enough for the cart to pass through. Looking through the slats in the
			side of the cart I could see the tunnel rock for about five meters, but further beyond
			it was total darkness.
		</p>
		<p>
			I imagined that the lever controlled the brakes keeping the cart in place, so pulling it
			would start the cart down the tunnel. But I wasn't sure if that was a good idea. The
			cart was not made for people, and I had no idea where the tracks lead. Atrus couldn't
			afford for me to take foolish risks and he if he were here, he'd advise me to find out
			more about the tunnel without going through it.
		</p>
		<p>
			But Atrus isn't here. I can't continually worry about what he would think about my
			actions. I'm not a foolhardy type, but I've never been known for my patience either.
		</p>
		<p>
			I pulled the lever and the cart began to move forward into the tunnel. There was a
			slight dip in the tracks ahead of me and I lost my balance inside the cart. The light
			ahead of me was fading fast, and the rock walls were quickly turning to the color of an
			endless night. The cool air flowed through the cart helping me get a sense of how fast I
			was going.
		</p>
		<p>
			The speed of the cart increased as it went through a series of high speed turns.
			Suddenly, the cart ran through a bright circular ring of lights, and then another. The
			rings were a brilliant orange in color, and each time I passed through one, I felt a
			massive wave of heat hit me from all sides.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly the walls all around me changed. The dark brown walls became a bright blue.
			From all directions I felt an occasional spray of water hitting me. From the front, the
			sides, and sometimes the behind. This tunnel was underwater! I could see water
			surrounding the cart on all sides. The walls must have been made out of some kind of
			transparent material. The only other structures in the tunnel were the firey orange
			rings spaced out in five meter intervals.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly, the track ran upwards and I emerged out into the open air. I shielded my eyes
			from the bright Riven sunlight as the cart ascended higher and higher into the air. The
			tracks were now twenty feet or so above the water level. The track was in the middle of
			the ocean surrounded on all sides by the islands of Riven. I looked behind me and saw
			the Jungle Island and next to it the first island with the gigantic metal dome. Ahead of
			me was a new island, and off to my left was another island I had never seen before.
		</p>
		<p>
			I never expected this cart to carry me this far. All my gear was back in the jungle.
			Would I be able to get back to it? What was waiting for me on this other island?
		</p>
		<p>
			This island was a small, level island with very few distinguishing features. The tracks
			ahead of me were rapidly approaching a cave, and I could make out a small building
			perched on the rocks.
		</p>
		<p>
			The entrance to the cave swallowed the small cart before I could get in any more
			details. The tunnels here were similar to the ones on the other island. Tight walls,
			sparse lighting. The air was cool and damp and I could feel the breeze now through my
			wet clothing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The lights ahead became brighter and the cavern opened up more. Directly in front of me
			I could make out the end of the tracks with a large bumper spring to stop the cart. I
			braced my body on the frame of the cart as it slammed into the bumper, bringing it to a
			stop right next to a small platform on my right.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly, the floor of the cart fell open like a set of bomb-bay doors. My body fell
			through the opening and slammed onto a large curved aluminum slide. I fell feet first
			and crashed against a round metal door. The door lifted open from the impact and the
			slide continued outside.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the end of the slide my body fell into a small hopper next to a platform. I layed
			down in the hopper, tired from my ordeal. My clothes were dirty and wet, my shirt
			ripped, and my body ached from being thrown around in the cart. I tried to recall what
			form of reasoning I had used that lead me to ride a mine cart clearly not meant for
			human use. I was glad Atrus wasn't around to remind me of the wisdom of my decisions.
