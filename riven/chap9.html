		</p>
		<p>
			I hid in the bushes of the jungle and planed my next move. It was just after mid-day and
			I had explored quite a bit of Riven. I had covered almost all of the four of the five
			islands, and as far as I knew, the only place I had yet to explore was the village. The
			only trouble was, the village appeared to be the area where most of the Rivenese
			congregated.
		</p>
		<p>
			I ate some of my rations as I read the notes in my journal. I made additions to my
			notes, drew maps, and reread old entries. The maps I was able to make on the machine
			from Survey Island were very helpful. If I had a chance to go back to there I'd bet that
			I could get Riven mapped down in even more detail.
		</p>
		<p>
			But doing so would risk being caught. It was only a small miracle that I hadn't been
			discovered already. The stranger that I ran into on Survey Island had either ran for
			help, or ran to escape from me. But nobody had come back to capture me, nor did they
			wait here for my eventual arrival. Why?
		</p>
		<p>
			Judging by the way the man was dressed, I assumed that he was a Guildsman, a member of
			one of Riven's five Guilds. Maybe he was with the Guild of Surveyors; maybe he was even
			the Guild Master.
		</p>
		<p>
			After I ate, I explored more of the jungle. Gehn had always assumed that the Black
			Moiety hid in the jungle, but if that were true, they were doing a very good job at
			hiding. I searched the trees and the bushes and found nothing. Nothing to indicate that
			they hid here. Maybe they used to hide in the trees, but moved on after Gehn started
			cutting down the forest.
		</p>
		<p>
			I took the elevator to the upper walkways and checked out the jungle from above.
			Although I had a much better vantage point, I still didn't see any signs of the rebels.
			Maybe Gehn was wrong about their hiding place.
		</p>
		<p>
			No, they were here at one time. They left the tiny knife that I almost tripped over
			yesterday, just like the one I saw the rebel jam into the link trap mechanism.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was standing next to the spinning dome, next to the metal stairway leading up and out
			of the jungle. I climbed the stairway keeping an eye out for the guard tower that was
			just over the rise. There was nobody in the tower. Either the guard was needed
			elsewhere, or the post was only manned during certain hours.
		</p>
		<p>
			The walkway went across the ravine and lead to a thick black metal column with gold
			trim. It was identical to the linking trap I was briefly captured in, except there was a
			oval shaped door on the front with a handle in the center.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned the handle and opened the heavy metal door. The doorway was the only source of
			light in the capsule. Inside there was a chair surrounded by a large ivory structure.
			Directly in front of the chair were two levers that ran under the floor.
		</p>
		<p>
			I sat down in the chair and closed the door behind me. Total blackness surrounded me and
			it took me a few seconds to adjust to the low light level.
		</p>
		<p>
			The curved ivory structure I sat in was about seven feet high and surrounded the chair
			on three sides. At the flanks of the structure were two long and very familiar tusks.
			The chair was made from the skull of a Whark.
		</p>
		<p>
			I reached out to the two handles. I pulled the handle on the right, but it wouldn't
			budge. I tried the left handle and felt the chair move. The chair started rotating to
			the left and then slowly lifted up. A bright light came from above as the roof of the
			capsule was splitting apart to accomodate the chair.
		</p>
		<p>
			The light became brighter as the chair rose to the top of the capsule and turned to face
			the crater on the other side of the ravine. I was overlooking the Riven village. Across
			the crater I saw the huddle of earth huts stucking out of the ground on their tall
			stilts. Towards the right side I saw a small landing with machines and tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			On this side of the crater was the tall metal structure. It was a large cone shape of
			bars rising from a circular platform just above the water line. The center of the
			platform was open, possibly to let people easily enter or leave the water. Looking up
			towards the top, the bars intersected at a metal hoop. Just above the hoop were five
			upright Whark skulls forming a circle. Above the skulls was a brass sphere. There was a
			wooden plank leading from the skulls to a metal walkway running along the wall of the
			crater. The walkway turned around the bend, and there was also a door leading to a
			tunnel in the crater wall.
		</p>
		<p>
			From here I felt like I could command the entire village. I sat at the highest point, in
			full view of all the huts below me. This must be how Gehn addressed the people of Riven.
			From here he saw everything, and everyone would have a full view of Gehn.
		</p>
		<p>
			It all made sense. The exits from the catwalks in the jungle were the mouth of the idol,
			and this chair. To reach the catwalks you could take the Mag-Lev from the Survey Island
			or the Linking Book in the Fire Marble Dome. Gehn used these secret paths to reach
			various points in the island in no time and to make it difficult for others to follow
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			I pulled the handle on my right. From down below me I heard a motor whir to life. Metal
			shutters closed together to cover the center of the circular platform. The design on the
			shutters resembled Gehn's crest.
		</p>
		<p>
			I pulled the left handle. Immediately the chair began to lower itself into the metal
			pod. It rotated back to facing the door as the metal covers sealed shut above me. I
			stood up and opened the door. I stuck my head out to see if there were any guards in the
			tower. Nobody had monitored my brief, unsuccessful attempt at impersonating the dictator
			of Riven.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked back into the jungle and thought out my next move. Since there was no guard in
			the tower right now and the village did appear deserted, I decided it was worth a chance
			to risk it. I had to go into the village to see what was going on.
		</p>
		<p>
			I approached the second jungle door leading to the canyon. To the right, the walkway
			lead down into a cave I hadn't explored yet. To the left, it ran towards a staircase
			that appeared to lead back up to the forest. The guard tower was still empty.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned right and walked down into the cave. The air was cooler and the walls were
			bathed in a deep blue light. There was a hole in the far wall that looked out towards
			the sea, just inches above the water line. The ground below me was damp suggesting that
			this cavern was occasionally flooded in.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the inside wall was a drawing done in chalk. The drawing was simple, reminding me of
			those depictions of cave paintings by early man. The image showed a large man holding
			two smaller men by their legs, allowing them to dangle upside down. directly below each
			man was a fish looking up towards the men as if the they were some kind of food to them.
			I assumed that the larger man was Ghen, and the two smaller people were subjects under
			his control.
		</p>
		<p>
			I continued through the cave which lead to a wide opening meeting with a wooden bridge
			above a pool of water. Beyond the opening I could see the bottom of the crater and some
			ladders running up the wall. I noticed a small child playing on the walkway. I ducked in
			the shadows of the opening as a woman walked over to the child and picked him up. Either
			it was probably the child's bedtime, or they had seen me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked out of the cave opening and looked around. There crater wasn't very large
			compared to the one on Book Island, but the it contained so much more. Huts, buildings,
			machinery, and the tall cone structure that seemed oddly out of place with everything
			else in the village.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bridge followed the crater walls around the lake. A small lantern was perched on the
			handrail every ten feet or so. The bridge widened out to a landing with a ladder leading
			down into the water.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked towards the ladder looked down below. Somehow the water was diverted from the
			area around the ladder forming a bubble of air. On the ground I could make out a metal
			square centered between two rails. The rails ran to either side of the square and
			continued running parallel to the boardwalk. When I looked directly at the square I
			could feel warm air flowing through notches cut in the square.
		</p>
		<p>
			The square must be some kind of a heat vent. Gehn wrote that the bacteria in the water
			avoided heat, but I didn't think it would be possible to form pockets of air this large.
			I looked up from the air pocket. I could make out other dimples in the water suggesting
			more air pockets in the lake. What were they for?
		</p>
		<p>
			As I scanned the lake, I noticed one particular rock about ten feet away from the dock.
			There was a mechanical apratus built into the middle of the rock with a long tubular
			extension sticking out from it. The tube was pointing directly at me and the landing. It
			was the camera. The camera Gehn had used to watch his villagers from the Survey Island.
		</p>
		<p>
			Was anyone sitting at it right now, watching me? Maybe the Guild Master had a chance to
			return to Survey Island when I wasn't watching the idol.
		</p>
		<p>
			I stepped up from the dock and began to walk back towards the cave. If someone was
			watching me, then more than likely the camera would pan to the right to follow my
			movements. I was walking backwards using the handrail for guidance, keeping my eye on
			the camera at all times. When I made it back to the cave entrance I was convinced that I
			was out of camera range.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was no movement from the camera. I stepped out from the cave entrance and waited.
			When I felt that my movements weren't being observered, I continued walking on the dock.
			Gehn had mentioned spying on the Rivenese in his lab journal. I remember he had said
			something about finding one of the wooden eyes that I had seen around the island.
		</p>
		<p>
			I stood by the metal ladder and looked around. About twenty feet away from the dock,
			past the camera was a small wooden ball floating in the water. I would make a note of
			checking the eye later on. Jumping in the water now, would make my presence more
			noticeable.
		</p>
		<p>
			The huts in the Riven village were build on complex wooden scaffoldings. I walked
			further along the dock towards a ladder that would take me up to the first level of the
			huts. I climbed the ladder to a small cluster of huts that were about twenty feet above
			the water line.
		</p>
		<p>
			Directly in front of me was a hut no more than eight feet tall. The doorway was a small
			metal door surrounded by the thich walls of earth. There was a simple window on the side
			wall of the hut, and a small bump on the top, used either for ventilation or maybe a
			cooking stove. I couldn't imagine such a structure holding more than one person
			comfortably, but the reality of it was that it probably held more.
		</p>
		<p>
			I counted 15 of these huts all along the scaffolding, but from what I knew the
			population of Riven had to be close to 200 people.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked past the hut along a walkway that hugged the rock wall. I passed another hut
			and an overhead walkway. There were three flat triangular shaped fish hanging from a
			pole next to the hut, probably the latest catch from a Riven fisherman.
		</p>
		<p>
			The walkway ended at an open ledge. Across the ledge was a large cone-shaped clay oven.
			Inside the oven was a fish lying on a metal grill above a wood fire. The fish looked
			like the ones I had just seen hanging outside one of the village huts. A few feet away
			from the oven were three short tables. They could only accomodate one person, and the
			gold table in the center had the shape of a Whark worked into its design. Was it Gehn's
			personal eating table?
		</p>
		<p>
			On the far side of the ledge, overlooking the village lake was a large vehicle mounted
			on twin rails. The design was similar to that of the MagLev, but this vehicle was much
			older and weathered. It was pot-belly shaped with extensions for four wheels resting on
			the tracks, and an extruded portal in the front. On top of the machine was a circular
			hatch that looked like it was designed to be air-tight.
		</p>
		<p>
			I climbed up the slightly wet handholds built into the side of the craft and opened the
			hatch. The vehicle had one metal seat riveted into the body of the craft on all sides.
			In front of the chair was a series of levers used to control the vehicle.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was probably a submarine of some kind, but what was it doing up here? I climbed back
			down to the ledge and looked over the vehicle. On the ledge next to the vehicle was a
			lever reaching into the ground. I pulled the lever. As the lever locked into place, the
			tracks underneath the vehicle descended, taking the small submarine with it. I looked
			down the ledge, watching the sub lower until it hit the waterline of the lake. After it
			touched bottom, a metal ring lowered from the side of the ledge until it linked up with
			the circular hatch on top of the submarine.
		</p>
		<p>
			I looked up from the sub and noticed a path that lead to the other side of the village.
			Across the ledge, I could make out the path I explored yesterday where I was spotted by
			the Riven guard in the tower. As far as I could tell, there was no other way to get to
			this path without literally circling the island.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked back towards the village, and back down towards the cave where I emerged from
			earlier. From the cave, I made my way back to the jungle paths and down the stone
			staircase that winded along the side of the island. I passed the rock the strange sea
			creatures rested, and finally made my way to the other entrance of the village.
		</p>
		<p>
			The guard tower was empty this time. The path lead to a ladder leading down to a smaller
			ledge below me. In the middle of this ledge there was a stone basin reaching up to waist
			height. Inside the basin was a small valve and another one of the wooden eyes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Turning the eye revealed the following symbol.
		</p>
		<div class="centered">
			<img src="./images/d2.gif" alt="d'ni 2">
		</div>
		<p>
			When I released the eye, it made a high pitched clicking noise.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned on the valve to get a drink of water. The water flowed out of the bottom drain
			hole and filled the bottom of the hand carved bowl. But before I could drink any, the
			water flow stopped. The water that was already in the basin had flowed down the overflow
			pipe in the side. Maybe this was a Riven source of drinking water.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned on the valve again to get some more water. It flowed out for a few seconds, and
			then shut off again. The wet surface of the bowl was discolored by the water strain,
			creating a silhouette. The wooden eye in the bowl was positioned so the image looked
			like some kind of creature. Something about it was familiar.
		</p>
		<p>
			I pulled the eye back again and listened to the noise it made as it rocked in the metal
			socket. The faint fluttering sound came from the socket again, sounding like something I
			had heard before. Something in the jungle.
		</p>
		<p>
			The beatle! It sounded like the buzz of the beatle. In fact, the silhouette in the bowl
			resembled the profile of one of the beatles. It looked just like the one I saw in the
			forest, and the golden ones I had seen in the gate room. If I could go back to the other
			eyes I had found, I may be able to see if the other eyes make sounds like other animals
			I had encountered on Riven.
		</p>
		<p>
			I left the basin and continued down two more ladders until I was on a path just above
			the water of the lake. The path lead to a short tunnel that lead to a metal dock.
			Directly underneath the dock was the submarine I had lowered down from the high ledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			The short metal dock had holes in the surface for water drainage. The end of the dock
			wrapped around a large metal ring that rested just above the circular hatch of the
			submarine. Along the edge of the ring was a ladder to lower me inside the craft.
		</p>
		<p>
			The water surrounding the craft was drawn away from the hatch by a wave of heat. I could
			feel the warm air under my feet as it flowed around the curved sides of the submarine
			from an underwater vent.
		</p>
		<p>
			I reached down, opened the hatch and lowered myself inside. The submarine was a bit
			confining, and I had to hunch my back slightly to get a full view out of the forward
			bubble. In front of me was a steering lever that rotated from left to right. Below the
			steering level was a lever capable of sliding left to right. On my right hand side was a
			long lever sticking out from the floor. Next to the bubble on my right hand side was a
			simple air gauge made from a glass tube and a light ball that would rise or fall
			depending on the inside air pressue.
		</p>
		<p>
			I closed the hatch above me and tried the lever on the right first. I pushed it forward
			hearing gears underneath my seat click and whir. The submarine started to move forwards
			along twin rails through the water. I felt the hull of the submarine rumble as it left
			the confines of the air bubble and submerged into the lake.
		</p>
		<p>
			The track curved around the perimeter of the lake rising and falling over the rough
			surface of the bottom. Up ahead I noticed another track running parallel to the one I
			was on and intersecting with this one at a switch junction. The submarine stopped at the
			junction, and the lever on my right reset back to its start position. From under the
			metal seat I heard a rumble of a small motor and a dull thud as metal connected to
			metal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through the forward bubble I could see the base of the tall cone. I also saw the wooden
			ball that was floating in the water. It was kept in place by a rope line anchored to the
			bottom of the lake.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned the steering lever to the right. The section of track below me then rotated
			counterclockwise. The controls must be connected to the track switch underneath me. My
			view swept across the lake until I found myself facing the track I came down on the
			left, and the new track to my right.
		</p>
		<p>
			Which track should I take?
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the lever in front of the steering column was already set in the right position, I
			figured the junction switch below was already angled to take the track on the right hand
			side. I pushed the hand lever forward and the sub slowly rolled up the tracks. The sub
			veered along the tracks on the right hand side lifting up the sloping ground. The sub
			continued until I noticed another air bubble in front of me. The viewport broke through
			the bubble, and I heard a rush as the water was suddenly swept away from the body of the
			sub.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned the wheel on the hatch and lifted it up to take a look outside. The sub was in
			the middle of the air bubble. To my right was the boardwalk. Attached to the boardwalk
			was the metal ladder assembly. Unfortunately, it was out of reach. I wouldn't be able to
			get out of the sub without jumping into the water.
		</p>
		<p>
			I looked around some more, seeing the rest of the lake from this vantage point. But my
			carelessness may have given away my presence, when I remembered that this dock was right
			next to Gehn's viewing scope, and it was still pointing right at me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I climbed down the ladder into the sub and locked the hatch after me. Now, how do I get
			out of here? The path ahead of me was a dead end. I turned the steering lever and the
			track below me rotated a half circle. I pushed the lever on my right pushing the sub
			forwards. Once again the sub was imersed in the water.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sub stopped at the junction facing the cone shaped cage. I pushed the lever forwards
			again. The sub moved on. The tracks rose up a small hill and through another air pocket.
			The sub entered the pocket and stopped. I opened the hatch and looked around.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now the sub was right next to the giant cone. There was another dock built into the
			base, but it was retracted, preventing me from leaving the sub. Since there was nothing
			else I could do, I closed the hatch and continued forward along the tracks.
		</p>
		<p>
			I reached another junction, this one with two tracks ahead of me on the left and right.
			There was also a fourth track that intersected with the junction behind me. I guided the
			sub to the right and continued along the tracks. The sub rumbled ahead and it arrived at
			another air bubble.
		</p>
		<p>
			I opened the hatch and looked up to see a ladder directly above me. I climbed up the
			ladder. Once I was out I realised that this was my starting point. I had taken the sub
			in a full circle. I looked back towards the lake to get an idea of where exactly I had
			traveled. I saw the cage across from me, and towards my right were two more air bubbles
			next to the shore.
		</p>
		<p>
			I climbed back into the sub and secured the hatch. I turned the tracks underneath the
			sub around and moved forward, backtracking towards the last junction point I was at. I
			was in the middle of an X junction, with immediate paths to my left and right. According
			to the map in my head, I had come from the left, so I sterred the sub to the right.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sub moved along the new track and rose up from the water into another one of the air
			pockets. I opened the hatch and climbed up a ladder that was extended from the shore to
			reach the sub.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dock lead to another ladder that ran up the cliff wall. At the end of the ladder was
			a large overhanging stucture. I climbed up the ladder occasionally looking around in all
			directions. Even though it was late, I felt that it was unusual that I wasn't attracting
			attention from the Riven villagers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The structure above me was man made, with a hole in the bottom allowing me to enter. The
			inside was hollowed out and had enough room for about three people. The floor was made
			from wooden planks and ran towards an assembly of levers on the far wall.
		</p>
		<p>
			Behind me was a wide narrow opening in the rock wall allowing me to look out into the
			village. From here I could see the entire lake and the village huts. Maybe this place
			was a guard tower.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned around and looked at the row of levers. There were 5 brass levers mounted at
			waist height, running to control rods the went down into the floor. Of the five levers,
			the first and fourth were in the upright position, the others were down.
		</p>
		<p>
			I touched the first lever and pulled it down. I didn't see any immediate indication of
			what the lever performed, so I tried pulling down the fourth lever. I tried a couple
			more levers around at random, each one squeaking as it moved. It appeared that they
			could only be set in an full upright or downward position. If I tried to leave a lever
			halfway up or a quarter way down, it would continue moving to the closest vertical
			position. That probably meant that the levers were switches. Whatever they controlled
			were either turned on or turned off.
		</p>
		<p>
			I left the levers and climbed back down the ladder. But when I reached the bottom of the
			ladder I realised the dock below me was retracted. Somehow my means of getting back in
			the sub had been altered.
		</p>
		<p>
			I climbed back up the ladder towards the overlook and inspected the levers again. One of
			these must control the dock below me. Maybe the levers control the docks all around the
			island. If I turned them all on, I'd be able to take the sub to all of the docks in the
			village.
		</p>
		<p>
			I tried flipping up levers four and five. I ran to the hole leading down the ladder and
			looked. From up here I could see the dock extend until it reached the hatch on the
			submarine. I stood up and looked out the opening. I paid close attention to the docks
			that I saw along the shore. Some were extended, some were not.
		</p>
		<p>
			I played with the levers for about five more minutes and by going back and forth between
			the levers and the narrow window I was able to make a chart of which levers controlled
			which docks. I made a chart in my journal.

		<p>
			I left the overlook with all of the docks extended. I climbed back into the submarine
			and closed the hatch. Turning the submarine around, I moved towards the X junction, and
			from there I streered the sub to take the tracks on the left hand side, taking me to
			what was the only area I hadn't yet reached with the sub.
		</p>
		<p>
			I opened the hatch which was directly underneath the docking ladder assembly. Beyond the
			dock was a small building recessed into the ground.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked down a set of stone steps towards the wooden door. I put my ear up to the door
			to listen for noises. When I felt confidant that the room was empty I opened the door
			and stepped inside.
		</p>
		<p>
			Past the entryway was a large room with a high ceiling. I walked down a center aisle
			past low benches on either side of me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Towards the far end of the room were two lamps with that were the only source of light
			in the room. The shades had painted images of the Whark around the surface casting
			colored shadows around the room.
		</p>
		<p>
			Between the lamps was a podium with a spherical shaped cage mounted on top. On the side
			of the podium was a lever. I gave the lever a few turns and a humming sound came from
			the bottom of the sphere. Light began to form in the center of the sphere, and that
			light took shape to form a three dimensional image. <em>Gehn.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			"Taracoi D'ni," he said. "Keebe yem revot. Amboy ambay tig tabon. Gobodo nah ya-gaben."
		</p>
		<p>
			As he spoke he turned his head, as if he was looking directly at people that weren't in
			the room. His looked towards the benches on the right, and then the left. I wasn't sure
			what he was saying, but I had the impression he was trying to take on a conversation.
			There were pauses in his speech as if he was waiting for a response.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Fam," Gehn said, as if he was acknowledging something.
		</p>
		<p>
			But Gehn wasn't really watching the room. If he was he'd probably be looking directly at
			me. This must be a recording of some kind.
		</p>
		<p>
			The image of Gehn stopped talking and slowly faded away. I stepped away from the
			projector and looked around the room.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were two blackboards on both sides of the room covered with large clearly written
			D'ni letters. I looked up and noticed that there were more D'ni letters, written on
			wooden blocks and hung up high around the walls of the building. There were 25 letters
			and none of them repeated. It looked like the entire D'ni alphabet was spelled out.
		</p>
		<p>
			This place was a school.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was where the children of Riven were taught. The Guild of Educators probably used
			this tiny one room school to teach Gehn's ways. Maybe they would be taught how to Write,
			or maybe they would learn how the D'ni Descriptive Books were constructed.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked towards the back of the school room towards a small table. In a bowl were some
			half-eaten Riven fruit and some papers with samples of D'ni writing. It looked like a
			school child's work. I wonder what was written down on the page. The beginning of a new
			Age perhaps?
		</p>
		<p>
			On the left side of the room on another table sat a curious looking machine. It had a
			wide circular base with a small window cut into the side. From the left and right sides
			of the base were two long poles that supported gallows. A tiny spool of thread on top of
			the gallows lead through a loop towards a wooden figure hung from his legs.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the bottom of the base was a wooden of an Whark, looking up with its mouth directly
			underneath one of the hanging figures. Behind the Whark head at the base of the toy was
			a wooden ring.
		</p>
		<p>
			I pulled at the ring, and it immediately revolved from the left side of the base to the
			right. The Whark head was connected to the ring, so it was now poised underneath the
			figure on the right hand side.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the tiny window a wheel started to scroll by with symbols visible in the tiny window.
			The wheel suddenly stopped and a single figure was showing.
		</p>
		<div class="centered">
			<img src="./images/d3.gif" alt="d'ni 3">
		</div>
		<p>
			The thread for the figure on the right hand side began to lower. The movement was
			staggered, lowering the figure, then pausing, lowering, pausing, and so on. The pattern
			repeated three times.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned the ring again from the right to the left. A new symbol appeared in the window
		</p>
		<div class="centered">
			<img src="./images/d7.gif" alt="d'ni 7">
		</div>
		<p>
			The figure on the left hand side lowered itself in seven even steps. I turned the ring a
			third time to see a new symbol.
		</p>
		<div class="centered">
			<img src="./images/d2.gif" alt="d'ni 2">
		</div>
		<p>
			The right hand figure lowered itself two times.
		</p>
		<p>
			This contraption was a toy, designed to teach numbers. Whatever number was displayed in
			the window was represented by the number of steps the figure would lower itself into the
			mouth of the waiting Whark.
		</p>
		<p>
			I continued playing with the game. At times when one of the figures would be low enough,
			the wooden Whark would snap its mouth closed on the figure.
		</p>
		<p>
			After about five minutes I had ten numbers written out
		</p>
		<div class="centered">
			<img src="./images/d1-10.gif" alt="d'ni 1-10">
		</div>
		<p>
			Ten different numbers, one through ten to be exact. Now I maybe I could use this
			information to figure out the combination of the Fire Marble Domes.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wrote down the entire D'ni alphabet in order, and continued looking around the
			building. There was nothing else that I could find helpful, so I left the schoolhouse
			and climbed back into the submarine. I turned the sub around and headed back towards the
			X junction in the tracks.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I reached the junction, I remembered that I hadn't looked over the giant cage. The
			docking ladder should have been extended, so I'd be able to leave the submarine and
			examine it more closely.
		</p>
		<p>
			I turned the sub a half circle and leaned it towards the tracks on the left. The
			submarine rolled forward on the rails around the corner and settled at the stop right
			next to the cage.
		</p>
		<p>
			I opened the hatch of the sub and climbed up the ladder. The cage was about thirty feet
			tall with a brass sphere at the very top. I could walk into the cage from the docking
			ladder, and the iris hatch just above the waterline was closed, giving me a surface to
			walk across.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I crossed the hatch I felt a heavy thump against the hatch knocking me off balance.
			Something had struck the hatch from the underside. The thumping continued for a few
			seconds and then subsided.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the far end of the hatch was a rope leading up to the sphere. The end of the rope was
			tied to a triangle shaped handle to provide a better grip. I pulled the handle. From up
			above I heard gears turning, and then a rope dropping from the sphere. At the end of the
			rope was a long metal bar with a ring at each end. The roped dropped down until it was
			only a foot above the hatch.
		</p>
		<p>
			It wasn't until I saw the rope that I realised what this entire cage was for. A cold
			chill ran down my spine, as if it had been touched by pure evil. The last time I had
			felt like this was back on the Channelwood Age, when I found the bloody sacrificial
			altar constructed by Achenar. This structure was a gallows, similar to the game in the
			school building.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was a brutal punishment, and I didn't want to even think about how many people Gehn
			had dispensed his justice on. He probably watched it from the high cliff. He controlled
			the iris hatch from his chair, and then someone down here by the hatch would actually
			pull the lever plunging the victim into the water. Then, they would be eated by the
			Whark.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked towards the middle of the hatch and examined the crossbar. It was made out of
			brass and it was surprisingly clean. I pulled lightly on the rope to test its strength.
			In response to the tug, the motor up in the sphere began to lift up the rope. I climbed
			up on the crossbar and held onto the rope.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sphere pulled up the rope to the top of the cage where a wooden plank bridged the
			cage with a metal walkway on the cliff wall. A circular red metal door was built into
			the cliff wall.
		</p>
		<p>
			I crossed the plank. The doors were made of metal bars allowing me to look inside the
			room. It was a single room made from stone blocks. There was a man lying against one of
			the walls. He appeared to be very tall and strong. He wore a red bandanna around his
			head keeping his long dark hair out of his eyes. His clothing was similar to the outfit
			the Moiety soldier I saw yesterday. This room must be a holding cell for prisoners
			awaiting execution.
		</p>
		<p>
			A few feet away from the door, well outside of a prisoner's arms reach was a wheel. I
			pulled the wheel from its socket and turned it around. The circular door to the prison
			cell broke apart in five sections, like rose petals slowly being plucked from a stem.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hoped I was doing the right thing. I didn't know how this person would react to my
			freeing him. He may try to help me out, or he may try to kill me to cover his escape.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the door opened, I stepped into the cell. The prisoner was gone.
		</p>
		<p>
			I immediately turned around, thinking that he had hiden behind the door to catch me by
			surprise. But he wasn't there. The cell was empty. I looked around the cell for any
			clues. I didn't see anything in the prison suggesting that anyone was ever here. But I
			had seen the prisoner with my own eyes.
		</p>
		<p>
			He couldn't have used a Linking Book, because the Book would have been left behind. So
			he must have left the cell through some other exit.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the floor of the cell was a tiny drain. The drain cover was on a hinge so I opened it
			up to look inside. The bottom of the drain was filled with water. I put my hand in and
			felt something. Making a fist with my hand I lifted up a metal handle, connected to the
			bottom of the drain. I pulled the handle up and I heard a rumble from the wall on my
			right.
		</p>
		<p>
			A section of the brick wall was sliding back, revealing a tunnel behind the prison cell.
			The prisoner was lying against this wall, only pretending to be asleep. He must have
			used this escape tunnel as I was opening the door to the cell.
		</p>
		<p>
			I climbed into the short tunnel and the brick wall closed itself behind me. The tunnel
			was lit by a single fire marble connected to a stick that was mounted to the side wall.
			The tunnel was only about five feet high, and I had no idea where it lead.
		</p>
		<p>
			I made a few steps forward and felt the ground slope downwards. There was also a cool
			breeze flowing, so I was pretty sure that the tunnel wouldn't lead to a dead end.
		</p>
		<p>
			I blindly felt my way across the walls, walking slowly in a hunched over posture. There
			was no light anywhere, and after thirty feet of stumbling I began to wonder if this was
			a bad idea. For all I knew, this tunnel was only one of many that I could now be lost
			in.
		</p>
		<p>
			Further down I began to hear the water. The smell of the open sea air was flowing
			through the tunnel. I rounded a corner and soon saw a ray of light. The tunnel had ended
			at the base of the island. The waterline extended into the cave, ending my downward
			path. On the cave wall there was another fire marble.
		</p>
		<p>
			This marble wasn't lit. I squeezed the marble between my fingertips and a soft glow
			began to eminate from the center. The bottom of the cave was soon bathed in a soft light
			that would eminate from the marble for days.
		</p>
		<p>
			Looking back up the tunnel I noticed another fire marble. I walked back up the tunnel
			path and turned this one on. Further down, I saw another marble. It would appear that
			the entire tunnel was set up to be illuminated.
		</p>
		<p>
			I made my way back through the tunnel, turning on the fire marbles as I saw them.
			Halfway up my path I saw a small stone door. I decided not to enter it yet, until I had
			all of the marbles lit up. I finally came back to the hidden door to the cell. Once I
			lit up all the marbles and found no other paths, I made my way back down the path
			towards the second door.
		</p>
		<p>
			The stone door was flush with the side wall of the tunnel and had a single rope run
			through holes on the side to serve as a handle. I pulled the door wide open, until it
			blocked the main path leading down. Through the doorway I could make out another light
			source. I got down on my hands and knees and crawled through the smaller tunnel.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tunnel ceiling sloped upwards leading into a large dimly lit chamber. The room had a
			dirt floor and brick walls. At the far wall, there was a brick circle surrounding a pool
			of water. The water was flush against the wall, held in place by a heat source coming
			from the surrounding bricks.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the middle of the chamber floor were stone slabs, almost resembling tombstones. There
			were twenty-five of them arranged in a circle. On the inside face of each one was a
			painting of an animal of some kind. They were relatively simple drawings, showing either
			a profile or a frontal view of the animals.
		</p>
		<p>
			I knelt down in front of one of the tomb stones and brushed away the dirt from one of
			the images. As I touched the image the stone began to sink into the ground. I pulled my
			hand back and the stone stopped when it was halfway submerged.
		</p>
		<p>
			I touched the stone next to it. It lowered itself into the ground just like the first
			one, stopping halfway before it was completely under the floor.
		</p>
		<p>
			I touched a couple of more stones and the reactions were identical to the first two.
			After I had touched a fifth stone, however, the four previous stones I touched
			immediately lifted themselves out of the ground.
		</p>
		<p>
			For some reason I began to worry about the possibility of booby traps. Darts spitting
			out of the walls, or hot lava pouring in from the ceiling. These stones were built for a
			purpose that I had no understanding of. I could touch these stones at random for the
			next two hours, and I doubted if it would get me anywhere.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reluctantly I tried it again. When I touched a fifth stone in a row, all of the stones
			reset themselves to their original position. If I were to guess at the function right
			now I would say that the stones served as a combination lock of some kind. Touch the
			right five stones and something would happen. Touch the wrong stones, and the system
			would reset itself to give you another chance.
		</p>
		<p>
			I decided to hold off on examining the stones any further until I had a chance to go
			over what I had learned in the village. It was already past midnight on Riven and I
			still had to catch some sleep.
		</p>
		<p>
			I made my way back up the tunnel and through the prison cell. I stepped out on the
			walkway and began to follow it around the side of the cliff wall. It ran along the cliff
			wall for about a hundred feet and ended at a folding ladder leading down. I extended the
			ladder and it allowed me to climb down to the lower walkway of the village. From there,
			I walked back to the caves and made my way into the safety of the Riven jungle.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once I was in the safety of the jungle I fell fast asleep.
