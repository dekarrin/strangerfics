		<h1>Chronological List Of Changes</h1>
		<p>
			The following is a list of updates/additions to The Riven Expedition...
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dec 18, 1997<br>

			<li>Dec 21, 1997<br>
			Finalized story outline</li>
			<li>Mar 31, 1998<br>
			No, I haven't forgotten. There are 7 chapters in <em>rough draft</em> right now. I need to do some scanning work, but they should be ready by mid April at the latest.</li>
			<li>Apr 9, 1998<br>
			Uploaded more images required for the story.</li>
			<li>Apr 10, 1998<br>
			Chapters 3 and 4 uploaded.</li>
			<li>Apr 11, 1998<br>
			Chapter 5 uploaded. I hope the Cyan employees have a sense of humor.</li>
			<li>May 10, 1998<br>
			Chapters 6 and 7 uploaded. Chapter 8 in first draft.</li>
			<li>Feb 25, 1999<br>
			Chapter 9 finished. (With the exception of a couple of images that need to be uploaded).</li>
			<li>Jun 2, 1999<br>
			Chapters 10 and 11 finished. Still need to upload more scanned images.</li>
			<li>Jul 6, 1999<br>
			Required images have been uploaded</li>
			<li>Jul 12, 1999<br>

			<li>Aug 1, 1999<br>
			Chapters 13, 14 uploaded. Fixed link problem with chapter 12.</li>
			<li>Aug 24, 1999<br>
			Chapter 15 uploaded. Chapter 16 in rough draft</li>
			<li>Oct 2, 1999<br>
			Chapter 16 uploaded. Chapter 17 in rough draft.<br>
			Chapter 16 took longer than I expected, mostly because I had little source 
			material to work with. And before you ask, this chapter is entirely 
			fictional, and I had no official input from Cyan on it. It's strictly an 
			interpretation.</li>
			<li>Oct 3, 1999<br>
			Chapter 17 uploaded. Not much too it, but I may make additions later.</li>
			<li>Oct 11, 1999<br>
			Chapter 18 uploaded. First draft of chapter 19 completed.</li>
			<li>Oct 26, 1999<br>

			<li>Nov 1, 1999<br>
			Epilogue Chapter uploaded.</li>
			<li>Nov 27, 1999<br>

			about 159 pages.</li>
