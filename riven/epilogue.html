		<p>
			<em>Three months later</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			We all sat around the coffee table in my den. Deforest, the Dean of Washington
			University, Watson, a graduate student studying human languages, Fryman, a metallurgist,
			Brandcamp, from the school's legal department, and Marty, a senior student in biology.
			In the past weeks, I had seen each one individually, but this is the first time we were
			all together.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had just completed telling them the story of Myst and Riven. Up until then none of
			them had heard the full story. I wanted to get their reactions when they were all
			together. I also wanted them to take the time to examine some of the artifacts I had
			recovered before I told them of their origins. I didn't want to risk clouding their
			judgements with tales of other worlds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Behind me was a blackboard with the words D'ni, Riven, Myst, Stoneship, Channelwood,
			Selentic, Mechanical. There were arrows between the words to show the relationships as
			to how you could reach these Ages with the Linking Books. On the coffee table were some
			of my sketches, and the journals I had written during my adventure.
		</p>
		<p>
			"An impressive story," DeForest said. "But I can't say that I don't have my doubts about
			some aspects of it."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ms. Hunt stepped into the room and dropped off a serving tray. "If you ask me, I thought
			it was all a bunch of hogwash," she said. "When I received his phone call over two
			months ago, I thought he had gone crazy, or had gotten himself into the usual trouble
			from one of his expeditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Until I saw him bring in that monstrosity," she remarked. She pointed to the giant
			Moiety knife that I now had mounted in the corner of the den. "Then, I knew that this
			wasn't one of his usual trips abroad."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Ah yes," DeForest said. He turned to Fryman the metallurgist. "No luck finding out what
			our mystery artifact is made of?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, I'm afraid not," Fryman replied. "It has all the characteristics of metal, but it's
			unlike any metal I've ever seen. And my searches of the symbol itself have found no
			matches against any of the cultural records we have at the University."
		</p>
		<p>
			DeForest turned back towards the aquarium setup that I had installed in the far
			bookshelf. "And then we have your mysterious frog to consider."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What's it called again?", Marty asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"A ytram," I replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Ytram," he repeated. "Spelled y-t-r-a-m?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes,"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Ytram is Marty spelled backwards," he said. "Are you sure you didn't just make this
			up?"
		</p>
		<p>
			I laughed. I didn't even notice the connection until he brought it up. "No, I did not
			make it up. I found written references to the word, so I'm sure of the spelling. It's
			probably just a wild coincidence."
		</p>
		<p>
			DeForest laughed. "Well, that should make it easier for you to justify a claim for
			discovering this creature," he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			We all laughed at that. Marty had ambitions, but I told him up front that the creature
			would need to be kept a secret. I didn't know what the biological makeup or the life
			expenctancy of the Ytram was. It could very well die next week, so what would be the
			point of making an announcement. I also had serious concerns about releasing the Ytram
			into our ecosystem.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Well Marty," I asked. "What can you tell me about the Ytram?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I don't think I can tell you anything about it," Marty replied. "I've checked out every
			amphibian species, and every reptile species, but I can't find any creatures that are
			similar to this. There are only 3 possible explanations. One, it's a new undiscovered
			species; two, it's a mutation; or three, it really did come from another world."
		</p>
		<p>
			"That's two unexplained phenomena," DeForest said. "And how about you Mr. Watson. How
			are you coming along with your analysis of the Books?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Watson picked up a notepad he kept and opened it up. Next to him on the end table was
			the Myst Descriptive Book, the D'ni Linking Book, A couple of Atrus' journals,
			Catherine's journal, Gehn's journals, and two of the Linking Books Gehn had used.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The paper and the inks are unlike anything I had ever encountered," He finally said.
			"The written language in the <em>Descriptive</em> and <em>Linking</em> Books is totally
			unknown. The style of the characters almost looked like a Hebrew script, but on closer
			examination it clearly isn't. There are 24 unique characters, and they are made from a
			common set of strokes divided into the top half of the letter and the bottom half of the
			letter.
		</p>
		<p>
			"To translate this would take years, and that's optimistic at best. The one good thing
			is that apparantly Atrus knew the English language somehow. That has to point to some
			possible relationship with his people and ours. If we could find some examples of D'ni
			writing mixed with English writing, we could have better luck in the translation. The
			number system is also entirely unlike anything I have ever seen before either.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Hmmm," DeForest thought about this. "This may be a mystery we will never solve in our
			lifetime." He returned to his chair and the others that were standing followed.
		</p>
		<p>
			"There's more," Watson said. "The Books that aren't written records do contain the one
			image just as described, and they do appear to be more than just a simple photograph."
		</p>
		<p>
			Watson held open the Myst Book for all to see. At my recommendation, the page with the
			Linking Window was covered with plastic to prevent anyone from accidentally Linking.
		</p>
		<p>
			They were dumbfounded, all of them. None of them could explain the reasons as to why the
			image shifted like it did. DeForest actually flipped the page over just to make sure
			nothing was behind it.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Anything else?" I asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			Watson put down the Myst Book and picked up one of the Books for the 233rd Age. "When
			you told me that an electrical current was required for this Book to work, I tried an
			experiment. After creating a small electrical field around the Book with approximately
			two megawatts of power, an image started to appear, just like the other Books."
		</p>
		<p>
			"So, what's to stop us from trying it now?" DeForest asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"There's the chance that we wouldn't be able to go back," I replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"But the Riven Book leads to the Star Fissue," he insisted.
		</p>
		<p>
			"But the Age was stable at the time. I'm pretty sure Riven has collapsed by now since
			Atrus has had no need to maintain the Book. The Book could lead directly to the Fissure,
			or it could lead to some kind of empty void."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Is there any way we can risk using the Book?" Fryman asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The best scenario would involve Atrus coming to Earth," I replied. "If Atrus could find
			a way to write a Linking Book to bring us back to Earth, and still have a way to bring
			it to us, then it would be safe."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Can he even write a Linking Book for Earth?" Brandcamp asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I'm not sure. Earth wasn't an Age he was aware of. There may or may not even be a
			Descriptive Book for it."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Preposterous," DeForest said. He stood up from his chair. "Do you really think that
			this planet was merely <em>written</em> into existance by people from another world?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, that's now how it works," I said. "The Descriptive Books merely create bridges to
			worlds that already exist. The D'ni had nothing to do with life on Earth or the creation
			of the planet."
		</p>
		<p>
			When it appeared that his concerns were alleviated, DeForest sat back down. "Well, if
			Atrus ever tries to come to our Age, how would we know. He'd probably arrive on that
			island you were stranded on."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I'm going to take another trip there in a month," I replied. "I plan to bring tracking
			equipment and communications gear to set up a system of detecting anyone. I'll also find
			a way to allow Atrus to contact me voluntarily if he does make the trip."
		</p>
		<p>
			"So what exactly happened after your trip through the Fissure," Watson asked.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>
			When my trip through the Star Fissue ended, I had somehow linked to another island.
			Later on, I would find out that it was a small island fifty miles off the coast of Isla
			San Felix. However, at the time I had no idea where I was. Earth? Somewhere else?
			Anywhere else? I was in a jungle in the middle of an island. About twenty feet away I
			could see a beach, and beyond that, a vast ocean.
		</p>
		<p>
			The D'ni Book was there as well, along with portions of the wooden bridge, the scope,
			and even the giant Moiety knife. I was glad that I had a few more artifacts to add to my
			collection, but I was also relieved because their presence gave me a vital clue. This
			told me that my trip was on a fixed linear path. Everything that fell into the Fissue
			ended up here.
		</p>
		<p>
			But did the Myst Book end up here? It had fallen into the Fissue over thirty years ago.
			What if the path had changed due to the instability of Riven. I had no idea where
			exactly the Miller Brothers (or perhaps someone before them) claimed to have found the
			Book.
		</p>
		<p>
			Off in the distance I heard a laugh. I immediately ducked down into the bushes. On a
			path deeper into the jungle, I saw two women walking side by side carrying woven
			baskets. They had long dark hair and wore simple gray dresses. They looked familiar to
			me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Were these women Rivenese?
		</p>
		<p>
			Long ago, Gehn had thrown Riven villagers into the Fissue for his experiments. I myself
			proved that a human could survive by traveling through the Fissue. If the path of the
			Star Fissue "was" constant, those same villagers must be here as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			I discretely followed the two woman down the path. Soon I reached a clearing next to a
			lagoon. The two woman set their baskets down next to a conical shaped stone oven,
			identical to the one I had seen in the Riven village. In the distance, I could see mud
			huts, similar in design to the ones I found on Riven. There was even a large scaffolding
			which held some huts twenty feed in the air.
		</p>
		<p>
			I sat at the edge of the jungle, and watched the huts from a distance. I had no proof or
			evidence that these people were from Riven any more than I was on planet Earth, and yet
			my gut instincts told me that they were Rivenese, and that I did make it home.
		</p>
		<p>
			I counted over 30 villagers. There were about fifteen adults and fifteen children. They
			had the same dark hair and taned complexion common to the Riven villagers. The clothes
			were similar too, but some differences were found. Most of the adults wore garments that
			resembled Riven clothing, but the children wore garments that appeared to be made from
			other materials. The Riven outcasts had to make due with the resources this tiny island
			offered.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I watched them I began to wonder if they had any desire to go home. I had the D'ni
			Book with me. What would happen if I were to let them use it? Atrus and Catherine would
			find them and then have them Link to Tay where the other Riven villagers lived. They
			could finally be reuinited with their loved ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			But would they do it? They've been here for over thirty years and they seemed to have
			rebuilt their lives in spite of what happened to them. Did they have any desire to go
			back to Riven? Up until now they never had the option of going back. Deciding the future
			course of their lives would not be an easy decision to make.
		</p>
		<p>
			But I felt that it wouldn't be right for me to deny them that decision. The next morning
			I would visit the village and present them the Book.
		</p>
		<p>
			I continued watching them throughout the night, trying to get an idea of how the village
			operated. I needed to get an idea of how the village functioned socially. With a group
			this small, who was the leader? Was it one individual or many? Did they try to recreate
			a D'ni-like or Riven-like system of order, or was a new one created? Did these villagers
			have any concepts of law and order, or were they lucky enough that their small size made
			the process of peacekeeping as simple as being a united people?
		</p>
		<p>
			I slept in the jungle that night, just like I had so many nights before. My gear had
			kept me warm and safe, just like it had in the Riven jungle. My sleep was so peaceful, I
			couldn't even remember what I had dreamed about.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next day came sooner than I expected. I checked my D'ni watch and was surprised that
			it was just past the second period. Time was different here. I couldn't be sure, but it
			had felt like an Earth day.
		</p>
		<p>
			I sat at the edge of the clearing and watched as members of the village began to leave
			their huts. It was the adults mostly. It was the start of another day, and no doubt
			there was work to do to provide for their families. In another few minutes who knew
			where they would be. I had to act now while they were all together.
		</p>
		<p>
			I left my gear behind for safekeeping. The only item I carried with me was the D'ni
			Linking Book. It was an incredibly brave thing to do, considering this Book was my only
			means off the island.
		</p>
		<p>
			I walked towards the village calmly and carefully. I wanted to make sure I was seen from
			a distance as non-threatening. I made my way through the jungle path and onto the
			clearing next to the lagoon.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first villager that saw me was a woman who was gathering a set of stone pots and
			setting them outside to dry out. She dropped the pot she was holding and ran towards
			another hut. She was obviously scared, but not to the point of hysteria. She knocked on
			the door of the hut while pointing at me with her finger. The other villagers that were
			awake were turning towards me now.
		</p>
		<p>
			I didn't move. I didn't want to frighten anyone, and it was of utmost importance that I
			was not viewed as a threat. I wish I had understood their language. I wished there was
			an easier way to communicate with them. The villagers that were already awake approached
			me, but kept a distance of five meters.
		</p>
		<p>
			I held out my hands with the palms outward as a peaceful gesture. I realised then that
			my clothing may be a considered a threat to them. The clothing I had worn since my stay
			on Myst was mostly D'ni, but it wasn't anything like the full dress uniforms Gehn wore.
			They may assume that I was in alliance with Gehn, or perhaps I was someone else
			proclaiming to be a god of some kind.
		</p>
		<p>
			Out of the gathering crowd, an older man stepped out and cautiously approached me. I
			slowly opened my pouch and took out the D'ni Linking Book for him to see. The man
			suddenly backed off. He retreated into the crowd and another man stepped forward in his
			place. This man was taller than the others, and he wore a necklace of decorated beads,
			more elaborate than the ones worn by some of the villagers.
		</p>
		<p>
			He stood in front of me and held out his hand. I leaned forward and handed him the D'ni
			Book. He opened the Book and flipped through the pages. His face had no expression, and
			he didn't seem surprised in the least about what it was. He looked up at me and closed
			the Book. Then carrying the Book he walked back towards the center of the village. I
			followed him.
		</p>
		<p>
			The villagers had gathered in a circle in the middle of the village. There were two
			circles of logs layed out around the perimeter to facilitate seating. Judging by the
			importance of the area I presumed that there were many meetings here. This was probably
			where the important decisions were made by the village as a whole.
		</p>
		<p>
			One by one, the villagers left their huts and gathered into the circle. It turned out
			that the count of villagers was closer to 60. The age spans between villagers was so
			wide, I had no trouble easily identifying the ones that had been thrown into the Fissue,
			the children that they had, and the children their children had.
		</p>
		<p>
			The leader of the group was clearly one of the first generation. He was also the tallest
			man, which gave him a commanding presence. He stood in the middle of the circle, next to
			a table. On the table sat the D'ni Book. I took a seat at the inside ring of logs close
			to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			The leader held up the Book for everyone to see. He spoke out in Riven phrases that I
			couldn't understand. He then opened up the Book towards the page used for Linking and
			made sure all of the villagers had a good look.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the villagers were amazed by the sight. Some of the older ones were fearful.
		</p>
		<p>
			The leader continued speaking. After a few seconds, an old Rivenese woman stood up and
			argued defiantly with the leader. They exchanged words back and forth. I could tell the
			woman was either fearful or suspicious. The leader remained calm when it was his turn to
			speak. I could have sworn I heard the woman mention Catherine's name.
		</p>
		<p>
			The leader spoke for another minute, and then there was silence. After a second or two,
			the villager next to me said a single word. Then another villager across the circle
			repeated the word. It sounded like they were voicing their opinions, or perhaps voting.
			Were they saying that they were willing to use the Book, or were they saying that this
			strange visiter's carcas would easily feed twelve children?
		</p>
		<p>
			All the adults had clearly voiced their opinion to the leader, and they were all in
			agreement. Some of the children looked up at their parents, confused and curious. One by
			one, they left the meeting circle and returned to their huts. The leader of the tribe
			remained standing next to the table where the Book sat. A woman, probably his wife
			walked up to him and they kissed. She walked back towards one of the huts and went
			inside.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a few seconds, the villagers exited their huts carrying sacks of belongings or
			their children in their hands. A line began to form at the head of the table. The first
			woman at the head of the line looked up towards the leader. He smiled at her as a signal
			of approval. She placed her hand on the window of the Book and Linked.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the children were astonished by what they had seen, as were some of the adults.
			Not too many of the common people of Riven had seen the Linking Books being used. Maybe
			nobody here had ever really Linked to another Age before.
		</p>
		<p>
			The line progressed. Someone new would touch the window and vanish. Parents had their
			children link through first. When the line had disappeared, I found myself alone with
			the leader of the village.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before he linked, I gave him a note from me to Atrus. I wanted to explain my actions to
			him regarding the villagers and I wanted to let him know that as far as I could tell, I
			had arrived on Earth allright. The leader took the note and Linked to D'ni. Now I was
			truely alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the next few days I spent my time on the island trying to find a way to get rescued.
			Using my old Earth watch, I had determined that I was either on Earth, or another planet
			that coincidentally had twenty-four hour days and a single sun and moon. While I was
			glad for the small miracle, I had never felt so tired before. I was so close to home,
			and yet so far.
		</p>
		<p>
			I burned signal fires, I watched beaches for signs of ships. For the longest time I
			nothing happened. I wondered about the possibility of building my own boat, but I feared
			that my poor naval skills would be ill-suited for such a venture.
		</p>
		<p>
			I spent my nights in the remains of the village, eating fruits and berries and whatever
			else the Rivenese didn't take with them. When the food ran out, I searched on my own.
			Luckily this island had provided more than enough food for the villagers. It would suit
			my needs just as well until I could find a way to be rescued.
		</p>
		<p>
			I thought about the D'ni Linking Book. For awhile it had seemed like this would be my
			only means off this island. But if I used it, I may never be able to get back here. The
			only thing that kept me from using it was the strong belief that I was indeed home.
		</p>
		<p>
			After about two weeks or so, I had managed to capture the attention of a passing
			freighter. A shipping vessil was heading south to Archipielago Juan Fernandez from San
			Isla Felix, and then further down to Punta Arenas. They had seen my fire, and upon a
			closer inspection saw me frantically waving from the beach. A boat was sent out and they
			picked me up. It took some convincing, but I had also managed to bring the Moiety knife
			on board, along with my gear bags.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was dropped off at Juan Fernandez where I contacted the American consulate and had
			some funds wired to me. I made contact with Belinda to let her know that I was allright.
			From there, I took another boat to South America and chartered a plane to take me back
			to the States.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			It was late now, and my guests were saying their goodbyes. They would leave tonight with
			a whole new viewpoint of me. They were all good friends, but I knew something like this
			was bound to change things in one way or another. Ms. Hunt already told me she believed
			me 100 percent. But I could tell that the others were skeptical. The brilliant
			scientific minds they possesed would take some time to understand this new concept of
			thinking. DeForest told me he enjoyed the story, especially the part about an Age
			inhabited by a superior breed of monkeys.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sooner or later, they would come around. The evidence I had brought back would lead to
			increased curiosities, and future investigations. I had inadvertently discovered a whole
			new world, something never before seen by any other archeologist on Earth. I knew then
			and there that I wasn't going to let this gift go to waste.
		</p>
		<p>
			Somehow I would try to learn as much about the D'ni as possible, and maybe I would risk
			taking a trip to D'ni. I had learned so much from Atrus, and yet I wanted to find out
			more. There were so many questions about the D'ni that went unanswered. I only hoped
			that within my lifetime I would be lucky enough to be a part of their world again.
