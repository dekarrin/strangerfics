		<h1>Author's Notes</h1> 

		<p><em>September 29, 1997</em></p>
		<p>
			In one month, Riven will be released. Around two months after that date, the Riven
			Journals will be complete.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before you ask, no I do not have an advance copy of Riven. I am just getting the site
			ready for the story. The prologue does not reveal anything about the game and will not
			spoil it in the least. If anything, the prologue is just a teaser chapter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Do I have any inside secrets? Well, yes to one degree or another, I do. This summer I
			had a chance to beta test Riven while I was on vacation, so I did get to see a small
			portion of the game. However, I signed a non-disclosure agreement, so I have agreed not
			to reveal any details about the game until the release date. For more details, read my
			account of my trip to Cyan Headquarters (coming soon).
		</p>
		<p>
			Writing the story is going to take at the very least two months. And that won't even
			start until I've successfully finished the game and gone over the notes I've collected.
			I still remember a good deal of the sequence from the beta testing, but I would rather
			not rely solely on those experiences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, writing the story for Riven is going to be more difficult than Myst from a
			sequence point of view. While Myst was very much a non-linear storyline, there still was
			a more defined structure. Myst was broken up into seperate areas of gameplay by the
			worlds linked to from Myst Island (Selentic, Mechanical, Stoneship, and Channelwood).
			And each world was independed of the others, meaning I didn't need to solve a puzzle in
			the Mechanical Age to proceed further in the Selentic Age. In Riven I don't have that
			luxury, because the story takes place in one single Age (an Age that spans 5 or 6 CD
			Roms, I might ad).
		</p>
		<p>
			So, I ask for patience. I have a good idea of where I am supposed to go when I start
			out, so it shouldn't take too long to get to the end. When I start the actual writing
			I'll update this page saying so.
		</p>
		<h2>Riven Completed</h2>
		<p><em>November 19, 1997</em></p>
		<p>
			A few days ago I have received my complimentary copy of Riven in the mail. Two days ago,
			I finished the game. Right now I am briefly experimenting with some of the <em>bad</em>
			endings of the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the course of gameplay, I have put together 39 pages of notes in an attempt to add
			realism to the story and to get a sense of how the story should be outlined. However,
			there are some answers that I would like to check over more extensively. In some cases
			it seemed to me that the only solutions to some puzzled relied solely on guesswork. I
			also want to experiment with rerunning some gameplay sequences for accuracy and to see
			how they may affect the ending of the game.
		</p>
		<h2>Title Suggestions - Solved</h2>
		<p><em>November 19, 1997</em></p>
		<p>
			To prevent confusion between The Riven Journals web site and this site that I
			created, I have decided to name the story, The Riven Expedition.
		</p>
		<h2>Completion</h2>
		<p><em>November 1, 1999</em></p>
		<p>
			I noticed that from one of my earlier notes on this page that writing this story would
			take <em>at least 2 months</em>. Well, I suppose it is truthful, but I didn't expect it
			to take 2 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the story is done, there are still some changes that I want to make. Most are
			editorial, and some involve technical errors I made in the story. However, the overall
			story will not change.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll continue to make updates to the CLOC page as they are made.
